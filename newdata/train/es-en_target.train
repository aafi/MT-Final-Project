"Valentino prefers elegance to notoriety"
On the occasion of the "Valentino: Master of Couture," an exhibition that opened this week in London, ABC speaks with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other of the Italian designer's famous clients.
Somerset House, former home of Queen Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting a Valentino Garavani exhibition.
During the inauguration of "Valentino: Master of Couture," the designer acknowledged a retrospective apotheosis that brings together over 130 couture gowns created by his fashion house over the past 50 years.
"I love this palace" he says, in his unmistakable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the culmination of a story whose only protagonist is "signore" Garavani, although it could not have been written without his distinguished clients.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the rarefied and distant world of the nobility.
In the first room of the exhibition, open until March 3, there are a number of private letters and photos signed by the cream of aristocracy, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan, Lord Snowdon, Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece to Margaret of England.
Valentino exhibits these personal memories as if they were trophies of his social ascent from humble couturier in Voghera, northern Italy, to idol of the international jet-set.
There is nothing wrong with loving royalty.
"At least they don't drop cigarette ends on your magnificent carpet, like some beautiful pop music celebrities do," says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the '60s and '70s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
"We all loved being invited to his chalet in Gstaad" says "Heini" Thyssen's ex-wife, a close friend of forgotten beauties such as Marella Agnelli and Eugenie Niarchos.
And yet, he is a star.

The Argentine model Valeria Mazza also recalls the couturier's charisma.
There were twenty of us, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
You could see and feel his "spirit" in every detail of the flat and its decor, the food and the music.
"All the guests were made to feel important and loved" recalls the top model, who started working with him during Haute Couture Week Paris, in 1995.
"His designs are works of art and so never go out of fashion" she concludes.
Nobility parade
He loves well-educated people who come from good backgrounds, and they love him.
One of the Somerset House galleries has been transformed into a glamorous, sixty-foot long catwalk which offers a role reversal: visitors take the place of the models and have to parade down the catwalk while looking at a dream "audience" wearing Valentino masterpieces, for example, the dress Jackie Kennedy chose for her wedding with Aristotle Onassis, the costume Monica Vitti wore in "La Notte" and the wool and leather coat that belonged to Empress Farah Diba.
In this crowd of mannequins, names stand out such as Sibilla of Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria and Sofia of Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the designer, in 2006
I remember it perfectly.
It was a pair of trousers, a shirt, a "gilet" waistcoat and jacket from the 1971-1972 autumn-winter collection.
"It was a gift he gave me" says Naty Abascal, one of the designer's muses.
"I prefer him to other designers because of his femininity, his great love of women, and because he enhances our beauty" added the former Duchess of Feria.
The princess and fashion advisor Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg also remembers the first time she wore a Valentino.
My time finally came in the late '90s.
"It was a dream come true" says Princess D'Arenberg, the widow of Rodrigo d'Arenberg.
"Valentino is indifferent to fashion, his obsession is timeless" says this Italian aristocrat who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess D'Arenberg looks after her couturier gowns with "the utmost care ... because a dress not just a dress, it's also the many memories that go with it."
The "king" of fashion
It took four months' work and 25 "girls" (as the designer calls his seamstresses) to create the pearl-encrusted, ivory-coloured silk gown with twelve different types of lace and a train four and a half metres long.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the leading authority of the specialist press, that dress represents a high fashion milestone of the late 20th century, "the return of high society clients."
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest-ranking distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, and awarded the Legion of Honour, Garavani accumulates as many honours as any of his clients' husbands.
"I've always been struck by his refined and calm manner, and his neat and perfect appearance" acknowledges D'Arenberg.
He was on the table of Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a great friend of mine.
If a princess says that...
The hardest job in the world: the human mules of Kawah Ijen
There are people for whom work is hell, and others who - literally - work in hell.
This is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who make their living taking sulphur from the Kawah Ijen volcano, east of the Indonesian island of Java.
To do so, he has to descend every day to the bottom of the crater, where the sulphurous gas emanating from the bowels of the earth solidifies on contact with air.
After breaking off large sulphur rocks, which in total can weigh up to 70 kilos, he carries them in two bamboo baskets on his shoulders along the steep stone paths.
It is only 250 metres to the top of the volcano, which rises to 2,386 metres above sea level, but the exhausted porters take over 40 minutes to get there, at snail's pace, keeping their balance and measuring their steps carefully to avoid slipping and falling over the precipice.
They know that one slip could cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist who plunged to her death a few years ago on the hazardous Kawah Ijen cliffs.
The Kawah Ijen miners are paid 5 euro cents for each kilo of sulphur removed.
Once at the top, they make their way past the tourists who photograph them like circus monkeys and then, lugging their heavy baskets, they walk three kilometres to the scales installed by a mining company a little further down, 1,850 metres above sea level.
This is PT Ngrimbi Candi, a company which, since 1960, has been exploiting the volcano, and quite literally its workers, whom it pays 662 rupees (5 euro cents) per kilo of sulphur.
It then sells the sulphur for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) to the petrochemical industry, as the mineral is widely used in everyday life and is used in the manufacture of matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even for whitening sugar.
There, his wage was 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day and the work was not as hard, but Anto has returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for a compelling reason which, in Indonesia, is as overriding as the sulphur: "I married a girl from Bali, where they are Hindu, and I've brought her to Java to convert to Islam."
Anto has asthma, he has difficulty breathing, coughs constantly and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases.
At 27 years old, Anto has been risking his life for three years in the Kawah Ijen volcano, and the sulphur has already begun to take its toll on him, even though he covers his face with special mask and goggles.
"I'll go on working two more years because I want to open a shop or study Spanish or French" he vows in more than acceptable English.
Defying the shadows, Anto descends the crater and lights the path with a small torch attached to the helmet he bought with his money.
Despite their huge profits, the mining company has not mechanised the sulphur extraction process to save costs, nor has it provided any equipment for the porters, who work for themselves and by the kilo.
"This work is for animals, not people" protests Madrusin, a burly 42-year porter who has been working at Kawah Ijen for three decades, since leaving school.
Every day, he and his fellow workers break off 15 tonnes of sulphur from the volcano, which three lorries move to the warehouse in Tamansari, 18 kilometres away along a goat path that passes through scrubland.
"I won't retire, I'll die here because the volcano has been my whole life" says Unainik, opening a mouth full of gaps where teeth use to be.
Singapore seeks babies to save its economy
Singaporeans blame their careers, stress and the cost of property and education for not having children.
I'm a patriotic husband, you're my patriotic wife, let's do our civic duty and create life!
It's purely an Internet thing, so we had to make it fun and amusing.
It's the biggest problem facing this country.
We are the world's worst at reproducing our own progeny, so we felt it was an issue we had to address.
We knew the Government had tried many things, like launching perfumes with pheromones or organising speed dating evenings.
Many of these ideas may have been creative, but they didn't necessarily work.
So we thought: why not be as creative as possible to solve the problem, by composing a rap?
It spends USD 1,300 per year on policies to encourage people to have more children.
A government package for marriages and parents grants up to USD 15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But this has all had little effect.
Singapore is a rich, high technology city State in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls.
The birth rate in Singapore, according to its national population division, currently stands at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was over 2, known as the replacement rate, was in 1976.
Tan Wei Ming, Director of Marriage and Family Policy of the National Population Division, said that it is a result of "better education" and "a wider range of career opportunities."
"This has given people a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priorities, beyond getting married and starting a family" he explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to increasing numbers of people who are single, and delaying marriage and births, which has resulted in a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an EU immigration policy aimed at dramatically increasing immigration to cope with the population decline has created resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites where xenophobia against many new immigrants is widespread and thinly disguised, especially the Chinese who are criticised for keeping wages low and not integrating.
Increased immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why, last year, the Singapore ruling party experienced its worst election result since independence.
Since the election there has been an attempt to correct the problem, with the highest taxes and levies for foreign workers.
While a fall in the birth rate has known effects on a nation's economic growth, tax revenues, healthcare costs and immigration policies, in Singapore's case there are also some unexpected consequences.
For example, it has started to influence the real estate sector.
Its urban development authority has started to control the number of small apartments, known as "shoe boxes," which can be built in certain areas of the city.
However, there is concern that they may promote a single-living lifestyle and discourage developers who want to build large family houses.
But, Lim Yew Soon, managing director of the real estate company EL Developers, says his "shoe boxes" sell much faster than larger units.
They are more popular, in the sense that the units sell days, even weeks, faster than larger units.
However, he admits that the new regulations give clearer guidance to developers, who previously had obstacles put in their way if they provided for too many small units in a project.
Too stressed
Singapore is a city State.
"People are very stressed, houses are expensive and so is education, so a lot of people are putting off having a family" says a young executive.
Other people can have children.
"But, for me, it is important to have my own money and time" says another young man of around 20 years old.
Men and women alike mention their careers, stress and the cost of property and education as the reasons preventing them from having children.
So, much as the Government is trying to encourage its citizens to have children, when it comes to babies, the Singaporeans have the last word.
What is privacy for an under 16?
In four cases, they associated the term with "something very much mine" on a personal level, and "in the user name and password" when applied to social networks.
"I wouldn't upload my deepest secrets in a post" says Jorge, aged ten, when trying to explain the meaning of privacy on sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, with which he has had accounts for two years.
On FB I upload nice pictures or games.
And I have fun with people I know.
"I wouldn't share a photo that isn't mine, or that belongs to somebody who's doing something stupid" he says.
The child recognises that it is bad to post obscene pictures of naked people, crimes, or write humiliating or aggressive comments.
Jorge says he knows the 35 friends he has on FB and his nine followers on Twitter.
His mother is included, and she has the password to one of the accounts.
"Social networking is fun, I can talk quickly to relatives far away or my friends" he says.
Nor would he take any notice of someone who recommends a stranger to him.
The boy says that no-one has suggested anything to him or asked him for his home address or phone number.
"If they pressured me or asked me for it, I'd just delete them from my account" he states.
This teenager is not alien to experiences of what is now known as cyberbullying.
An acquaintance of a friend of mine was being pestered on a social network.
They were threatening him and demanding money from him.
"I never found out who it was" he says.
"He just made it private."
He then explains a series of steps to configure the account safely.
I would do it if I didn't like somebody, or they made me want to do it.
"However, I know that's cyberbullying" he admits.
Key questions
Porras says the scholar Marc Prensky, with a Master's degree in Education from Yale University and author of the work Digital Natives, Digital Immigrants, coined these terms to explain the phenomenon.
Digital natives are those children and young people born with technology.
"They also have to be selective when what matters most is to be popular and have thousands of friends, without thinking of the consequences" he adds.
According to the specialist, the most effective way to teach children and teenagers what privacy is, is through questions that make them think.
Porras then lists some options: There are things you wouldn't tell a stranger, so why do it online?
Or, would you like a friend to publish a photo of you like the one you posted of a friend?
Do you know what others publish about you?
When tagging party photos, did you ask the other people's permission to tag them?
The rules are the same.
"Outside the Internet, people act with respect, morality and other principles, so they should act the same way on social networks" he says.
Monitoring
By understanding all the clauses, they have solid grounds to talk to their children about the implications of opening an online account.
"For example, the age at which you are allowed to share or publish" he says.
According to Guardia, it is important to remind children the "don't talk to strangers" lesson.
Unasur Summit closes without making public the Lima Declaration
The Sixth Presidential Summit of the South American Union of Nations (Unasur) concluded today in Peru without making public the Lima Declaration, previously announced and theoretically signed by the seven attendee leaders.
During the summit, in the press room, only video was aired, with no sound, showing the presidential meeting with the message "closed session, audio restricted."
The little information that circulated among reporters was given by the press spokesmen of some of the UNASUR governments attending the meeting, but not the Peruvian Government.
Last October, Peru hosted the Third Summit of South American-Arab Countries (ASPA), and this time, despite repeated requests from the press, the previously announced Lima Declaration was again not made public.
At both international events, the Peruvian authorities were at pains to ensure that there were broadcasting systems assured for all the journalists, but limited the obtaining of information to a maximum.
The Presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met during the regional event and confirmed that they will respect the decision of the International Court of Justice (ICJ), which on Monday, at The Hague, will start to hear the arguments of both parties, in the lawsuit Lima has filed against Santiago.
"We will obey and execute the order that currently defines the differences we are bringing before this international court" said Humala, together with his Chilean counterpart.
Confirmation of both presidents that they would submit to the ICJ came after Colombia this week denounced the Bogotá Pact, whereby it accepted to submit to the judgement of this international court, following a decision on its maritime boundary with Nicaragua which it regarded as seriously flawed.
Paraguay, which was suspended by UNASUR in 2011 after the dismissal of former President Fernando Lugo, was not involved in the meeting.
Host President Ollanta Humala was responsible for opening the session in the morning and closing the summit, just after noon in Lima.
He reported that actions are being implemented to improve "cooperation in the fight against insecurity and transnational organised crime, actions to make medication more accessible, low-cost Internet access in all areas of South America, and to deal jointly and efficiently with risks of natural disasters."
With Europe in crisis, "economic consolidation (in Latin America) should not have a triumphalist attitude but should serve to expand its productive matrix and glimpse a better future for its people" Humala added.
"We decided to focus on a group of 31 flagship projects that will improve connection among areas of South America, especially in rural and border areas... uniting our countries and creating new economic networks" said the Peruvian President in a message read out.
Among these projects, he mentioned that five are in Peru and are located in the transverse axes of its territory, between the coast and Brazil, and two focus on increased connection with Ecuador, although he gave no further details.
"We hope the electoral process in that country serves to reincorporate it in the Union of South American Nations," from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a prosperous, peaceful and integrated nation, with good neighbourly relations, was another issue highlighted by the summit.
In this sense, the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before attending the start of the regional event that he expected to meet with his counterpart from Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico, to respectfully discuss the maritime dispute after the failure of the ICJ, questioned by Bogota.
"The day after tomorrow (Saturday) I might have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega" Santos said.
"With President Ortega, I hope I can say that we handle this in the most civilised and respectful manner possible" said Santos.
Santos and Ortega are due to meet on Saturday in Mexico, where they expect to attend the inauguration of the country's new President, Enrique Peña Nieto.
Also, as part of the summit, the bloc's foreign defence ministers met in advance to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus on defence in the region.
Peru has the pro tempore presidency of the regional bloc.
"South America should learn from Europe to integrate citizenship" says Rafael Correa
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, said today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal that "South America, in this case, must learn from Europe."
To this end, he defended the project to establish South American citizenship encouraged by member countries of UNASUR.
"We have to achieve the free movement of citizens and workers for any South American country, as is already the situation with members of the Andean Community. However, there are still reactionary sectors that want us to return to the past" he said.
The Ecuadorian President was also in favour of the restructuring of the Organisation of American States (OAS) under the premise of reducing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon states and taking into account those who have signed the Pact of San José on human rights.
Those who speak with authority never commit to anything, whereas we South Americans sign everything.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington under US funding" he said referring to Ecuador giving political asylum to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Additionally, he criticised the Swedish courts for demanding that he be subject to questioning for an alleged sexual offence in his country, when "Swedish legislation itself dictates that he can be questioned via videoconference, which could be done from the Ecuadorian Embassy in London."
Correa said that there is a risk of deterioration of Assange's physical and mental health.
"I have not spoken to him since he was at our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he had a minor lung problem, nothing serious" said the Ecuadorian President.
What there is, is the danger that his physical and mental health may deteriorate due to being locked in a small space without any outdoor exercise.
Correa said that the solution to the asylum granted to Assange in June by the Ecuadorian Embassy, in London, through the issue of a safe-conduct pass that permits travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the European legal authorities, and stressed that there have been talks with London to seek a solution to the imprisonment of the WikiLeaks founder.
We do not negotiate with human rights, we do not use that word in this case, but there have been ongoing discussions.
"The solution to this problem is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the European legal authorities, because Assange's lawyer, Baltazar Garzon, is handling a series of cases in different European courts" he said.
And if Sweden, as its legislation perfectly well allows it to do, and as it has done in other cases, questions Mr Assange at the Embassy of Ecuador in London, or interrogates him via Skype tomorrow, this problem is over.
Correa took the opportunity to reassert himself as a defender of freedom of the press and stated that what he does not tolerate is "the mediocrity, dishonesty and lies that undermine the freedom of expression."
"The greatest enemies of the press freedom are not evil and wicked politicians, but bad journalists depending on profit, blackmail and extortion" he said.
In that regard, he welcomed the fact that it was no longer these journalists, "or the bankers or bourgeois and hegemonic countries that dominate Ecuador" and said that, if re-elected, he will "step up the revolution to continue on the same path and in the right direction."
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto on Paraguay in UNASUR, at least until their next elections, arguing that the body "must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and a coup masked with legality" because this will in fact "destroy the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy."
The Ecuadorian President also considered the "perfectly pertinent" desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to now negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime boundary between the two countries, after the ruling of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, in favour Nicaraguan maritime sovereignty.
For now that ruling is not being followed.
It is a problem between a South American country and a Central American one.
Conflict is inevitable, but must be overcome by the desire to walk together.
With reference to the possibility of his standing as a candidate in the upcoming presidential elections in Ecuador seeking a third consecutive term, he said he sees that possibility "with much optimism and joy, although at times it is pretty hard."
Personally, I've never been interested in power, but in situations as unjust as those in Ecuador, socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by political power.
"My political movement believed that it was me who ensured that probable victory, so we have to accept that responsibility" he said.
If I won, it would be my last period in office and then I would leave public life.
"It's a decision" he confirmed.
"This does not mean a health relapse for President Chavez" he said.
Fabrizio was 21 years old when they confirmed his test result: HIV positive.
"It was like a bomb dropped on me" he says, recalling the time of the announcement, which the doctor was trying to make "softer," apparently unsuccessfully.
He decided to care for his illness alone and began to learn about it; thanks to his efforts he has just celebrated his 43rd birthday.
Fabrizio has lived with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, hard to imagine in the early '90s, when there were many questions, few treatment options and a great deal of stigma.
Then, even the director of an IMSS [Mexican Social Security Institute] clinic refused to discharge him "because he had a cut."
At that time, having Aids was synonymous with death.
Now it is possible to survive the syndrome and do so with quality of life.
However, many people are still unaware of their illness, and only seek help when the virus has already caused havoc, "exhausted" their immune systems and they are suffering from opportunistic infections.
Infectious disease specialist and expert in HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva said that since 2008 scientists had concluded that AIDS was not a death sentence, but that life expectancy and quality of life depend on the degree of damage to the immune system that patients present when they are diagnosed, with a higher life expectancy for non-drug users: up to 30 years for patients with a 200 CD4 count and 50 years for those reporting a 500 CD4 count.
In simple terms, this means that anyone diagnosed HIV positive at 25 years old, under these terms and "as long as they keep it under control, can live with no problems to 75" said the interviewee.
To gauge this progress, it should be remembered that the average life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years.
Although mortality has dropped significantly in recent years and, in the case of Mexico, the number of people dying of AIDS has fallen from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNAIDS annual report), it is also true that since the advent of AIDS, 60 per cent of patients in the national database have died.
In Jalisco alone, only 255 people died in 2011, and there have been 187 deaths up to May of this year; however, we are assured that there has been universal access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005.
- Why are do still deaths occur?
- I think the problem is not to do with access to treatment.
He gave a compelling statistic: "Nine out of ten patients arrive when they already have an opportunistic infection, so what needs to be done to have a greater impact on overall mortality is to make earlier diagnoses and, therefore, offer mass detection tests for everyone who needs them. "
Specialists and officials of the State Council of AIDS Prevention in Jalisco (COESIDA) agree on this proposal, as do the patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who came to be tested at a private laboratory, motivated only because a friend had done so and, despite his young age, he was around in the AIDS era and had even suffered Kaposi sarcoma, a cancerous tumour that is one of the common complications.
Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
To date, his parents are only aware he had cancer.
They should get tested if they are at risk. because the sooner they know if they are HIV positive, the better, and if they have already been diagnosed, they must learn to live like any other person, while being responsible.
This is his message, which summarises the theme of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
The gaps between health programmes and ordinary citizens are huge, said Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara who has taken up the HIV cause.
In places dedicated to this task "the distribution of condoms has actually increased; previously, they used to give us one or two, now they give us packets of a hundred, and that's fine, but it turns out there are still people out there who have no access condoms" he said.
It was decided to change such inefficient allocation, and that condoms should not only be placed behind counters, but that packets of one hundred should be found in public toilet dispensers in places frequented by young people.
This is not promoting promiscuity.
It is not about paying for their beers or motel fees, as Governor Emilio Gonzalez said, when asked if there would be distribution of condoms during his administration.
"And it's not about sexuality, but it is best to provide condoms to those already practising sexual activity" he said.
Jalisco key points
The state is 4th in the nation in new and cumulative cases of AIDS and 13th in HIV.
92% of new infections are through sex, 6% via the bloodstream and 2% perinatal.
An estimated 50,000 people may be living with HIV, as for each registered case there are around 4-5 people who do not know they are positive.
Ratified by a United States court of appeal, a judgement which ignores the restructuring of the Vitro Group's debt achieved via a bankruptcy in Mexico, the scenario is an ominous precedent for any national company with offices in the neighbouring country that has solvency problems.
It seems, then, that the proceedings in support of survival of firms permit Mexican law are not valid in the land of stars and stripes, contrary to international conventions.
In practical terms, the endorsement of the judgement delivered on 15 June by Judge Harlin Hale of the Bankruptcy Court of the Northern District of Texas, leaves Mexican firms defenceless against possible seizure of their property outside of Mexico.
However, the decision opens the door for the leading glass manufacturer in Mexico to appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States, claiming three inconsistencies.
From the start, while the trial judge notes that creditors should be governed by the United States Bankruptcy Code, the Court of Appeal for the Fifth Circuit, based in New Orleans, states that the main action is the insolvency action handled in Mexico.
The first point would involve ignoring international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of companies with transnational profiles.
Secondly, the judgement establishes that without the intercompany vote, with the debts the Vitro subsidiaries had with their parent company recognised in the critical mass of the insolvency, the majority needed to approve the restructuring might not be achieved.
However, Mexican law recognises the possibility.
In fact, the Vitro case was not the first one in which the scheme was accepted.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Commercial Mexicana, whose intercompany debts were endorsed by the Federal Bankruptcy Institute.
What is also certain is that, not including the votes of subsidiaries, the Vitro creditors who fought against it in the US courts, namely "vulture" funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergence, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited, did not achieve a majority.
The vote was apparently 45 percent versus 37.
This data is omitted by the Court of Appeal.
From another perspective, the latter blames Vitro for the difficult situation it has faced since 2008, while trying to avoid the severe economic crisis faced by the United States, turning its back on the country.
For now, the Gonzalez Sada family firm has lodged a motion for reconsideration before the Court of Appeal for the vote to reach the plenary of the court, that is, the five judges, given that only three voted previously.
Should this fail, an appeal for review by a higher court, in this case the US Supreme Court, will be filed.
The real problem is that the court bypassed a document sent by the Government of Mexico in the capacity of amicus curiae ("friend of the Court"), which details the procedure followed by Vitro under the framework of the Commercial Insolvency Law, noting that the latter discharged itself with adherence to the agreements signed by the two countries to link it with Chapter 15 of the Bankruptcy Act of the United States.
Moreover, it should be noted that the country yielded to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, that is the rules set for cross-border insolvency cases, ensuring fairness for debtors and creditors.
Double whammy: Vitro hit and country hit.
The proceedings headed by Carlos Diaz Chavez Morineau has just filed a criminal complaint against the National Banking and Securities Commission, which is accused of obstructing justice.
The claim is that the supervisory authority has consistently refused to provide reports to the Attorney General's Office on a transaction carried out by the employer to remove 198 million pesos from trust F/589 of Banco IXE, on behalf of Mexicana de Aviación.
The resources were apparently channelled towards the purchase of shares in the company Administradora Profesional de Hoteles.
As you know, Azcarraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
A group of local and foreign environmentalists, academics, businessmen and members of the public gathered at the weekend at a forum at the University of the Caribbean to approve the creation of a broad front to oppose the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
As you know, we are talking about a huge sales and distribution centre in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean, selling Chinese products, with a residential area at the bottom for employees of 150 companies.
Previously, Canacintra had managed to unite the governors of the southeast of Mexico to oppose the monumental building that destroyed part of a protected area and represents the mother of all threats to industry.
The death of ACTA
The Government ignored an order of the Senate to explain under what terms and conditions the Mexican Ambassador in Japan signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, known by its acronym ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property, and the matter has already been archived.
As you know, the action was taken even though the Senate had ruled out the possibility, deeming it an infringement of freedom of expression on social networks.
Homex long term
In effort to repay long-term debt without affecting short-term debt, the housing developer Homex is placing securities exchange certificates on the market for 500 million pesos.
The issue is the first of four identical issues which are offering to repay interest every 28 days.
Birth of Competival
A consortium under the name Competival has just been established, comprising the companies NYCE, e-Quality and Kernet, leaders in information technology, the objective of which will be to market the services of software clusters in Central and South America.
Basketball globetrotter Hector "Hetin" Reyes was involved in the sport for over 60 years and, thanks to it, travelled the world.
"I wore lots of hats in basketball throughout my life, including several at the same time, like when I was president of the BSN, general manager and federative president of the National Team during the '90s," recalled Reyes during Primera Hora's visit to his home in Bayamón, where he lives with Isabel, his loyal wife for over 50 years.
Reyes is not exaggerating when he makes that statement.
The walls of his house are almost totally decorated with pictures and memorabilia denoting his long career, which goes to prove it.
Of them all, the ones he treasures with the most emotion are the ones that remind him of his time spent with the Vaqueros, from the mid-50s as a player until 1982, when he completed 15 years serving as co-agent or agent of the franchise.
"Those were my best years, the ones I enjoyed the most because I had the opportunity to be part of the Vaqueros' eight championships, since 1967, either as agent, co-agent or manager.
There were many good years, including the five consecutive championships from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye with one in 1981, Jerome Mincy's debut year in the BSN.
Then "Cuco" Ortiz took over - he was a great manager" said Reyes.
Do you want him?'
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico ever had.
Bartow then recommended the sharpshooter Gausse Raymond, who established residency here and was one of our best shooters.
The Vaqueros' championship with Gausse was enjoyed, but from a distance, because in 1988 he was already becoming a federative bigshot.
For that time, he preferred to enjoy his own and Mincy's accomplishments in the national team.
I remember when we beat the United States for the first time during the 1989 Pre-Olympics in Mexico.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we came fourth and it should have been bronze, but for the Canadian referee who made us repeat the final play for the second time, said Reyes.
Is the 1990 World National Team the best you've ever seen?
It's one of the best, as good as the one that beat the Dream Team in the 2004 Olympics.
However, my favourite was the one in the 1991 Pan American Games in Cuba, when we won gold and gave the US team a beating, which was quite similar to the time we won bronze at the World Cup.
That team not only again included Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and 'Piculín' (Ortiz), but also the young (Javier) 'Toñito' Colón and James Carter, the Leon brothers (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario 'Quijote' Morales, who was kept out of the 90 team by a knee injury.
With role players such as 'Canito' Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner replacing the players suspended after the shambles of the Mar del Plata Pan-American Games, we won gold against all the odds.
Who was the best Puerto Rican player?
Without any doubt, Piculín Ortiz.
His numbers at international tournament level are awesome.
Nobody in Puerto Rico has dominated at that level like Piculín did.
Not to mention his career in the various leagues he played in.
Who was the best Puerto Rican manager?
That's a difficult one.
We had a very good team, including Julio Toro, Flor Melendez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
Of the youngsters, I really like the work of Leo Arill.
What was there left for you to do?
There were things I'd have liked to implement, such as regionalising the minor leagues.
At least I see the fruit of compulsory certifications and a course for leaders, table officials and referees.
That pleases me.
Larry Hagman, born on 21 September 1931 in Fort Worth (Texas), became world famous for his role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "JR," in the television series "Dallas," in which he played a ruthless, malicious and manipulative businessman.
He was 81.
"Larry was back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, once again representing the iconic role he most liked" the family said.
Larry's family and closest friends were with him in Dallas for the Thanksgiving Day holiday.
He brought joy to all who knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, loving and talented, and I will miss him dearly.
"He was an original guy and lived life to the full" said Gray in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver in 1992 and admitted that he had drunk a lot over the years.
In 1995 a malignant tumour as found in his liver and he underwent a transplant.
Years before "Dallas," Hagman became famous on television as a decent guy in the light comedy "I Dream of Jeannie," aired on NBC from 1965 to 1970.
He played Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life is changed when he meets an attractive genie, played by Barbara Eden, and takes her home to live with him.
He also starred in two sitcoms that were not aired for long, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His film work included roles well received by critics in "The Group," "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors."
But it was his masterful interpretation of delightfully detestable JR that led to Hagman reaching his peak of stardom.
The drama series on CBS about the Ewing clan and other characters in their orbit aired from April 1978 to May 1991.
The tagline "Who shot JR?," designed to generate hype around an episode full of emotions in which Hagman's character is nearly killed, generated international speculation and millions of risky dollars wagered in gaming establishments.
When the answer was revealed in an episode in November 1980, an average of 41 million viewers tuned in and made "Dallas" the second most watched entertainment programme in history, after the final episode of "MASH" in 1983, which had 50 million viewers.
It was JR's sister-in-law Kristin (played by Mary Crosby) who shot him.
Hagman portrayed Ewing as a corrupt insatiable man with a charismatic smile: a dishonest entrepreneur and cheating husband who tried to have his alcoholic wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), sectioned.
"I know what I want on JR's tombstone" Hagman said in 1988.
It should read: "Here lies the honest citizen JR Ewing."
Victoria Principal, co-star of the original series, recalled Hagman on Friday as someone "huge, on and off screen."
He is unforgettable and irreplaceable, for millions of fans around the world, and in the hearts of each one of us who was fortunate enough to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were broadcast a few months ago with great success for TNT.
He had already finished recording five episodes for the second series and a sixth was in process, the chain reported.
Immediately after, there was no statement from Warner or TNT about how the series would handle the loss of Hagman.
Hagman, born in Fort Worth, Texas, was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who starred in classics such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan."
While there, he met the young Swedish designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two sons, Preston and Heidi, and lived for a long time in the Californian city Malibu, home to many celebrities.
In 2001, he called his memoirs "Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales About My Life."
"I didn't put anything in it that I believed would hurt anyone or affect them in any way" he told Associated Press at the time.
After his liver transplant, he became an organ donation promoter and worked as a volunteer at a hospital, helping fearful patients.
"I advise them, encourage them, meet with them when they come for their surgery, and afterwards" he said in 1996.
I try to offer some comfort, such as "Don't be afraid, it will be a little uncomfortable for a short time, but then you'll be fine."
He was also an anti-smoking activist and took part in several campaigns.
Start of a course that explores the "End of the World"
But Charmé had no idea what awaited him over the next couple of months: The cataclysmic hurricane Sandy, a fiscal precipice some called "debt Armageddon" and a growing conflict involving Israel, where end-of-the-world Christians theorists think the Apocalypse will begin.
"I didn't realise this was going to be the most apocalyptic term ever" said Charmé this week to students at Rutgers-Camden University (New Jersey).
If you look at what has been happening in the world today as if we were at 30 days and counting, this has been a really good period.
And remember that bad is good for those with an apocalyptic mentality.
At Temple, Associate Professor Barry Vacker is giving the course "Media, Culture and the end of the world."
Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
"We looked at why these ideas proliferate over time" he said, and how they offer hypothetical scenarios that guide human behaviour.
If nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could break out.
This month students analysed movies with an apocalyptic theme and explored how they compare with real-life examples.
"I've tried to inform students about what is possible, probable, credible and impossible" said Vacker.
At the main Pennsylvania State University campus, Latin American History Professor Matthew Restall, and his colleague Amara Solari, an Associate Art History and Anthropology Professor, have teamed up to give a course, called simply "The end of the world."
Despite the "impending doom," students have to study, undertake projects and take final exams.
At Penn State, the final exam will be taken on the eve of the Apocalypse, which leaves students no choice but to work "until the very night the world is supposed to end" said Restall.
The courses proved quite popular.
"It was fully booked within two hours" said Restall, on his course for students with high averages, which was filled with 35 students.
Students, meanwhile, say the course is one of the most interesting around.
"I find it fascinating to see what people do to console themselves" said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old post-graduate Religion and Sociology student from Haddonfield, New Jersey, at Rutgers-Camden.
And the apocalyptic, secular or religious mentality is just a matter consolation or a lack of it.
But none of the students interviewed - much less any professor - said they believed in the end date of December 21st.
"Our first project was about the Mayan prophecy and to a certain extent we discredited it" said Julie Zeglen, a 21-year-old final year student at Temple, from West Chester.
But he said that Western culture suffers from apocalyptic anxiety, which goes back several centuries, in which people react to changes around them by predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has caused a boom in these speculations.
"In other places, people don't think about it" he said.
It's mostly in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a Professor of religion at La Salle University, who is giving courses in the Philippines this year, responded quickly to the question of whether he knew about any courses on the "end of the world" there.
"The Philippines are not taking part in the end of the world" he wrote, suggesting an exception of a higher authority.
Restall noted that over the years there has been talk of many days of the last judgement, and said that if nothing happens on December 21st, "people will immediately start thinking of the next date" or philosophising that December 21st is the beginning of a seven-year period after which the world will end.
Students and teachers are taking the date lightly.
Some said they plan to go to "end of the world" parties.
"Maybe I'll call some friends so we can have a laugh together" said Samira Ford, 20-year-old communications student.
"Valentino prefers elegance to the notoriety."
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino: Master of Couture," which has opened this week in London, ABC speaks with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous clients of the Italian designer
Somerset House, former residence of Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition about Valentino Garavani.
The designer has acknowledged during the opening of "Valentino: Master of Couture," a tremendous retrospective that brings together more than 130 haute couture dresses created by his "house" over the past 50 years.
"I love this palace," he says with its unmistakable Italian accent.
This show is the pinnacle of a story whose only protagonist is "Il signore" Garavani, but that could not have been written without his distinguished clients.
Valentino has always felt fascination with the rarefied and distant world of the nobility.
In the first room of this exhibition, open until next March 3, there are plenty of private letters and photos with the signing of the most prominent of the aristocracy, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon and Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margarita of England.
Valentino taught these personal memories as trophies of their upward mobility: From humble city dressmaker Rabbi, in northern Italy, idol of the "international" jet-set.
To be in love with royalty has nothing wrong.
"At least they did not go out of their cigarette butts bonus on your magnificent carpet as they do some beautiful celebrities of pop music," says Fiona Baroness Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 1960s and 1970s, both lived in the Alps and we were good friends.
"We all loved to be invited to his chalet in Gstaad," explains the "exmujer" Heini Thyssen, intimate of forgotten beauties like Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
And yet, it is a star.
Valeria Mazza, wearing a Valentino
The Argentine model Valeria Mazza nor forget the charisma of the dressmaker.
We were 20 people, among which were Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
In every detail of the floor, the decor, food, music, everything looked and felt his spirit.
"Each of the guests made us feel important and loved," recalls the "top model," which began working with him during the Paris Haute Couture Week, in 1995.
"Never goes out of fashion because their designs are works of art," topped off.
Lineage parade of
He loves to people with good education and better titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries of Somerset House has been transformed into a glamorous catwalk sixty meters long that proposes a change of roles: The visitor takes the place of the models on the catwalk and must parade to contemplate a "dream" audience that looks masterpieces of Valentino, such as the Jackie Kennedy chose to dress for her wedding to Aristotle Onassis, costumes that Monica vitti used in "La Notte," or a wool coat and skin that belonged to Empress Farah Diba.
In that public glitter names like mannequins Sibilla of Luxembourg, Gloria von plane und Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario Bulgaria or Habsburg Sofia.
Naty Abascal and dressmaker, in 2006
I remember it well.
It was a pair of pants, a shirt, a jacket "Gillette" and a jacket from the autumn-winter collection 1971-1972.
"It was a gift that I did it," says Naty Abascal, one of the designer's muses.
"I prefer him over others for their femininity, for his great love for women, because it enhances our beauty," added the former Duchess of Fair.
The princess and fashion prescriptora Patricia della Giovampaola d 'Arenbergtampoco can forget the first time he took a Valentino.
Finally, the time at the end of the 1990s.
"It was a dream come true," says the widow of Rodrigo d 'Arenberg.
"Valentino is indifferent to fashion, his obsession is timeless," explains this Italian aristocrat who lives in Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess D 'Arenberg keeps his clothes off the dressmaker with "the maximum care... because a dress is not only a dress, it is also the set of memories that entails."
The "king" of fashion
It took four months of work and 25 "girls" (as he calls the dressmaker his seamstresses) to develop the ivory silk suit with inlaid pearls, twelve different types of lace and a queue of four and a half meters.
According to the journalist Suzy Menkes, the highest authority of the specialist press, the dress represents a milestone of haute couture from the end of the twentieth century, "the return of the clients of the high society."
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest-ranking distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, decorated with the Legion of Honour, Garavani accumulates so many honors as any of the spouses of her clients.
"I have always been struck by its refinement, his calm, his appearance spotlessly clean and perfect," acknowledges D 'Arenberg.
He was on the table of the Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a great friend of mine.
If it says a princess...
The hardest job in the world: The human mules Kawah Ijen
There are people for whom his work is a hell and another that, literally, works in hell.
This is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who earn their living making sulphur Kawah Ijen volcano, east of the Indonesian island of Java.
To that end, it has to go down each day to the bottom of the crater, where the sulphur gas emanating from the bowels of the Earth solidifies to come into contact with the air.
After booting large rocks of sulfur, which in total come despite some 70 kilograms, carries on two bamboo baskets that burden on his shoulders through rugged stone paths.
There are only 250 metres to the top of the volcano, which rises to 2.386 meters of altitude, but the exhausted porters takes more than 40 minutes to reach a snail's pace, keeping the balance and measuring his steps to tempt them to tune and not fall over the precipice.
They know that any traspié could cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist who despeñó years ago by the cliffs of Kawah Ijen.
The miners of Kawah Ijen earn 5 euro cents for every kilogram of sulphur extracting
Once up, open passage between the tourists that the photograph as if they were circus monkeys, and loading laboriously heavy baskets, walk three kilometers to the balance that a mining company has placed a little below, 1,850 meters high.
It is PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that runs the volcano since 1960, and never better said, its workers, who pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 euro cents) for each kilogram of sulphur.
Then sells for 10,000 rupees (83 euro cents) to the petrochemical industry, since this mineral is widespread in everyday life and is used to manufacture matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even to launder the sugar.
There, his salary was $75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day and the proportion was not so hard, but Anto has returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village close to the volcano, for a good reason that, in Indonesia, is as strong as sulphur: "I married with a young woman from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I have brought to Java to convert to Islam."
Anto has asthma, breathing with difficulty, constantly coughs and irritate the eyes for the toxic gases
His 27 years, Anto carries three playing Kawah Ijen in his skin, whose sulfur has already begun to pass bill despite covering his face with a mask and special glasses.
"I will work two more years because I want to open a store or studying Spanish or French," promises in a more acceptable than English.
Defying the shadows, Anto low to the crater alumbrándose with a small flashlight attached to his helmet, which he himself has bought with their money.
Despite its huge profits, the mining company has not mechanized sulphur extraction to save costs and provides no equipment to the porters, who work on their own and so much weight.
"This work is for the beasts and not for the people," protest Madrusin, a burly carrier 42 years Kawah Ijen in three decades, since leaving school.
Every day, he and his colleagues start 15 tons of sulphur to the volcano, three trucks to move to the Tamansari warehouse, 18 kilometers away on a path of goats among the weeds.
"I am not jubilaré, I will die here because the volcano has been all my life," proclaims Unainik opening the mouth, where missing several teeth.
Singapore is looking for babies to save the economy
Singaporeans blame the race, stress and the cost of the properties and education for not having children.
I am a patriotic husband, you are my wife patriotic, the fulfilment of our civic duty and we believe life!
This is purely from the internet, so we had to make it fun and funny.
It is the biggest problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world in reproducirnos ourselves, so we feel that this was an issue that we had to deal with.
We knew that the government had tried many things, such as launching perfumes with pheromones or organize parties quick quotes (speed-dating).
Many of these ideas may have been creative, but not necessarily worked.
So we thought, why not make the most creative as possible to solve this problem, which is to compose a rap?
Spends $1,300 a year on policies to encourage people to have more children.
A government package for married couples and parents gives up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and doles out tax benefits.
But all this has had little effect.
Singapore is a city rich state and high-tech in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls.
The birth rate in Singapore, according to their national division of population, currently stands at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was above 2 - known as reposición- rate was in 1976.
As Wei Ming, director of Marriage and Family Policies of the National Population Division, said that it was due to a "better education" and "a wider range of career opportunities."
"This has allowed people to have a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priorities, beyond getting married and starting a family," he explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to the increase in unmarried, and to delay marriage and the births, which results in a decline in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy hat tip to increase dramatically immigration to stand up to the decline of the population has created resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites where abounds barely disguised xenophobia against many new immigrants, particularly the Chinese, who are critical for maintaining low wages and not be integrated.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why last year the governing party of Singapore experienced its worst election result since independence.
Since the election, there has been an attempt to correct the problem, with higher taxes and quotas for foreign workers.
While the fall in the birth rate has known effects on economic growth of a nation, tax revenues, healthcare costs and immigration policies, the example of Singapore is also having some unexpected consequences.
For example, has begun to affect the real estate sector.
The authority of urban development has moved to control the number of small apartments, known as the "shoe box," which can build in certain areas of the city.
However, there is concern that can promote a lifestyle of unmarried and discourage developers who want to build big houses, family members.
But Lim Yew Soon, director-general of the real estate company EL Developers, says that his "shoe boxes" sold much faster than the larger units.
They are more popular, in the sense that the units are depleted days, even weeks, faster than the larger units.
However, he admits that the new rules give clearer guidelines for developers, who before they put obstacles if they wanted to offer too many small units in a project.
Too stressed out
Singapore is a city state.
"People are very stressed, the houses are expensive and so is education, so many people are postponing," says a young executive.
Other people may have children.
"But for me it is important to have my own money and time," says another young man of about 20 years.
Men and women mentioned his career, stress and the cost of the properties and education as the reasons that prevent them from having children.
So, as much as the government tries to push its citizens to have children, when it comes to make babies, Singaporeans are those who have the final word.
What is private for a 16-year-old child?
In four cases, associated the term "something very mine," on a personal level, and "on the key and user name," when they applied to social networks.
"My deepest secrets not would rise to a post," says Jorge, ten years ago, when he tries to explain the meaning of private on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where it accounts for two years.
In FB go pretty images or games.
I also entretengo with my acquaintances.
"Do not share a picture that is not me, or someone who is doing the ridiculous," he says.
The child recognizes that it is wrong to publish obscene photographs of naked people, crimes or write comments humiliating or violent.
Jorge ensures meet the 35 friends in FB and its nine followers on Twitter.
The mother is included, holds the key to one of the accounts.
"Social networks are entertaining, I can speak with distant relatives or with my friends quickly," says.
Nor would do if someone to recommend to a stranger.
According to the boy, neither he nor has hinted he has asked for the home address or phone number.
"If I had put pressure or I demanded simply the sack of my account," acknowledges.
The boy would not are outside the experiences of what is now known as ciberbullying.
An acquaintance of my friend were extorting on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"Never knew who he was," he says.
"It only put privacy."
Then explains a series of steps to configure the account safely.
It would, if I fall ill or I have wanted.
"Although I know that that is ciberbullying," he says.
The key questions
Batons points out that the academic Marc Prensky, master's degree in teaching at Yale University and author of the book Digital Natives and Immigrant, coined these terms to explain the phenomenon.
The digital natives are them, children and young people who were born with technology.
"Also to be selective when what matters most to them is to be popular, have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," he adds.
According to the specialist, the most effective way to teach what privacy to children and adolescents is through questions that make them think.
Then, Porras lists some options: There are things that you do not contarías to a stranger, why you do on the Internet?
Or, do you would like to publish a photo of yourself as you have made a friend?
Do you know what the other published on you?
When labels photos of parties, do you have requested permission from the other people to label them?
They are the same rules.
"One off the Internet acts with respect, morality and other principles, as should be on social networks," he says.
Surveillance and monitoring
To understand each snippets they have solid foundations to talk with their children about the implications of opening an account on the Internet.
"For example, age and what is allowed to share or publish," he says.
According to Guard, is key to remind the children the lesson of "do not talk to strangers."
The Unasur summit ends without making public the Declaration of Lima
The VI presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) concluded today in Peru without being made public the Declaration of Lima, previously announced and theoretically signed by the seven leaders assistants.
During the day only aired in the press room, the video without sound of the presidential assembly with the message "private session, audio restricted."
The little information that circulated among the reporters was delivered by the press spokesmen of some of the governments of the Unasur attending the appointment, though not Peruvian.
Last October, Peru hosted the III Summit of South American-Arab Countries (ASPA, and on that occasion, despite being required insistently by the press, nor spread also called the Lima Declaration who had previously announced.
In both international events, the Peruvian authorities have worked in that would have insured transmission systems for all journalists but limited to obtaining information.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met during the regional meeting and ratified it will respect the decision of the (ICJ), which starts on Monday in The Hague to hear arguments from both sides, in the process that Lima filed against Santiago.
"We will abide by and run the ruling that defines the differences that today we are taking this international court," said Humala, along with his Chilean counterpart.
The confirmation of the two presidents that will be submitted to the ICJ occurred after Colombia reported this week the Pact of Bogotá for which had agreed to submit to the failures of the international tribunal, following a decision on maritime boundaries with Nicaragua who considered seriously wrong.
Paraguay, suspended Unasur from 2011 following the dismissal of its former president Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
The host president, Ollanta Humala, was in charge of opening the deliberations in the morning and closing the summit, shortly after noon of Lima.
He reported that promote actions to improve "cooperation in the fight against insecurity and citizen against transnational organized crime, actions to make medicines more accessible, the internet access at low prices in all corners of South America, and meet jointly and efficiently the risks of natural disasters."
With a Europe in crisis, "the economic consolidation (in Latin America) should not have a triumphalist matrix but should serve to expand nustra productive matrix and look forward to a better future for our peoples," he added Humala.
"We have decided to give priority to a group of 31 flagship projects that will improve the connection of the spaces of South America, especially in rural areas and borders... uniting our countries and generating new economic circuits," said the Peruvian president in a message read.
Among these projects, he mentioned that five correspond to Peru, and are located in the transverse axes of its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and two points to a greater connection with Ecuador, but gave no further details.
"We hope that the electoral process in that country for their return to the Union of South American Nations," which is currently excluded.
Latin America's need to remain as a region of prosperity and peace, integrated, and good relations between neighbours, was another of the issues underlined by the summit.
In this sense, Colombia's president, Juan Manuel Santos, said before starting his participation in the regional meeting that he hoped to meet with his pair of Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico in respectful way to treat the maritime dispute after a ruling of the ICJ, questioned by Bogota.
"Tomorrow (Saturday) it is possible to have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega," said Santos.
"With President Ortega hope I can tell you that we handle this the most civilized and respectful way possible," added Santos.
Santos and Ortega would be found on Saturday in Mexico where they plan to attend the takeover of command of the new president of that country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
Also, as part of the summit, the ministers of Defense of the bloc previously met to approve the Action Plan of the year 2013, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus in terms of Defence in the region.
Peru has the pro tempore presidency of the regional bloc.
"South America must learn from Europe to integrate a citizenship": Rafael Correa
Ecuador's president, Rafael Correa, said today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal that "South America, in this case, yes, you must learn from Europe."
He defended, in that sense, the project to establish citizenship initiative to encourage the member countries of the Unasur.
"We need to get the free movement of citizens and workers for any South American country, as is already the case with the members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary sectors that we want to return to the past," he warned.
The Ecuadorian president was, moreover, in favour of the recomposition of the Organization of American States (OAS) under the premise to reduce the influence of the Anglo-Saxon states and take into account those who have signed the pact of San Jose on human rights.
Those who give chair never commit to anything and, on the other hand, we all signed the South Americans.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights in Washington under the financing of the United States," he said in allusion to the political asylum given by Ecuador to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.
He criticized, in addition, the Swedish justice to demand that it put on its territory to the interrogation for an alleged sexual offence when "the Swedish legislation allows you to do so by videoconference, which could be done from Ecuador's embassy in London."
Correa said that there is a risk that deteriorates the physical and mental health of Assange.
"I have not spoken to him since he is in our embassy, but the ambassador told me that he had a small lung problem, nothing serious," said the president of Ecuador.
There is a danger that deteriorates their physical and mental health for being locked up in a small space, without being able to exercise in the open air.
Correa said that the solution to the asylum granted Assange since June in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, by granting a salvaconducto that will allow him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European legal authorities and stressed that there had been talks with London in search of a solution to the confinement of the founder of WikiLeaks.
We don't negotiate with human rights, that word does not use it in this case, but there have been ongoing talks.
"The solution to this problem is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European legal authorities because the lawyer for Assange, años Garzón, is making a series of procedures in different European authorities," he mentioned.
And if Sweden, as well as to its legislation and as it has done in other cases, questioned Mr Assange in Ecuador's embassy in London or interrogate him via Skype tomorrow is running out this problem.
Correa took to assert itself as a defender of press freedom and explained that what is "does not tolerate mediocrity, the bad faith and lying, which infringe freedom of expression."
"The greatest enemies of freedom of the press are not politicians wicked and evil but the bad journalists in terms of profit, blackmail and extortion," he said.
In that regard welcomed that are no longer these journalists "neither bankers nor the bourgeois and hegemonic countries that dominate in Ecuador," and said it to be re-elected "will deepen in the revolution to continue the way and in the right direction."
Correa also supported the decision to keep the veto to Paraguay in the Unasur at least until the next election, in arguing that the agency "must be firm and does not tolerate opportunism and marbled coups d'etat legality" because in reality "shattered the legitimacy of the Paraguayan democracy."
The Ecuadorian president considered, in addition, "perfectly appropriate" to his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, now negotiate with Nicaragua maritime boundaries between the two countries after the ruling of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which benefited the Nicaraguan maritime sovereignty.
For the moment it is not abide by that ruling.
It is a problem between a South American country and one in Central America.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the willingness to walk together.
Referring to the eventuality that were present as a candidate in the next presidential election in Ecuador to seek a third consecutive term pointed out that sees that possibility "with a lot of optimism and joy, although sometimes it is quite hard."
Personally, I was never interested power, but in situations as unfair as the socio-economic poverty in Ecuador that can only be correct from political power.
"My movement Montcada 6 believed that it was I who guaranteed that likely victory, because we have to accept that liability questions," he said.
To win it would be my last period in the presidency and hence we leave public life.
"It is a decision," he said.
"Does not mean a relapse in the state of health of President Chavez," he said.
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he confirmed the result of the test: AIDS positive.
"It was as if I dropped a bomb," referring to the recalling the moment of the announcement, that the doctor was trying to do more "suavecito" without apparent success.
He decided to take charge of his illness and began to learn about it; with such efforts already celebrated his birthday 43.
Fabrizio is living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) from 22 years ago, something hard to imagine in the early 1990s, when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigma.
Then, to the director of a clinic of the IMSS avoided say goodbye to him "because it brought a cut."
Then, having AIDS was synonymous with death.
It is now possible to survive this syndrome and do so with quality of life.
However, ignorant of his illness, many people still come when the virus has already caused havoc, "exhausted" their immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.
Infectólogo and expert on HIV / AIDS, Andrade Villanueva said that since 2008, scientists had concluded that AIDS was not a fatal judgment, but the years of survival and quality of life depend on the degree of involvement in the immune system with patients at the start of the diagnosis, with best expectation for those who are not drug users: Up to 30 years with a 200 CD4 count and 50 years ago, when CD4 500 reported.
In simple words, this means that anyone who receives a diagnosis of HIV-positive at the age of 25, under these terms "while remains in control will be able to live without problems to 75 years," explained the interviewee.
For sizing this progress, it should be remembered that the life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years on average.
While the mortality rate has dropped significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people who die from AIDS fell from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNAIDS) annual report, it is also true that since the emergence of AIDS, 60 percent of patients in the national database have died.
Only in Jalisco 255 people died in 2011, and van 187 deaths until May this year; however ensures that there is universal access to anti-retroviral drugs since 2005.
- Why still deaths?
- A me, it seems to me that the problem is not access to treatment.
He gave a blunt fact: "Nine out of ten patients arrive when you have an opportunistic infection, what needs to be done in order to have a greater impact on the overall mortality, is to make early diagnoses more and, therefore, they have to offer screening tests on a massive scale, to all the people who require."
In its proposal coincide specialists and officials from the State Council AIDS Prevention in Jalisco (Coesida), also the patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who went to be tested by a private laboratory, only motivated because he had done a friend and, despite his young age, was already in the era of AIDS and even suffered Kaposi's sarcoma, a cancerous growth that is one of the most common complications.
Everything changes when you know that you have AIDS.
To date, their parents only know that suffered from cancer.
To take the test, whether they had risk, that between quickly know whether they are HIV positive, it is better and if they already have a diagnosis, to learn that they can live like anyone, being responsible.
This, his message, sums up the theme of the AIDS battle this 2012.
There are large gaps between the health programs and the ordinary citizen, said Ricardo Salazar, a journalist who has taken up the cause Tapatio around HIV.
In the places dedicated to this task effectively "has increased the distribution of condoms, before they gave us one or two, now give us a hundred packages, and that is very good, but it turns out that there are those who today, we still do not have access to a condom," he said.
He proposed to redirect this inefficient allocation; that condoms are not only after the counters and those 100 are in public restrooms dispatchers sites that frequent the young.
It is not encourage promiscuity.
Nor is paying them the chelas and motel, and said the governor Emilio González, to ask him if he would have distribution of condoms in his administration.
"This is not sexuality, it is best to bring condoms to those who already are engaged in a sexual activity," he said.
In Jalisco keys
The state is 4 ° place nationally in new cases and 13 ° cumulative AIDS and HIV.
92% of the contagion corresponds to the sexually, 6% to the blood and 2% in the perinatal route.
It is estimated that 50 thousand people may be living with HIV because there are registered a case for 4-5 people who do not know it.
Ratified by an appeals court in the United States a judgment that ignores the Group's debt restructuring of Vitro achieved via a commercial competition in Mexico, the scenario puts a negative precedent for any company with national ramifications in neighbouring country with solvency problems.
It seems, then, that the procedures in endorsement of survival of the firms that allow Mexican laws are not valid in the country of the stars and stripes, against the grain of international conventions.
In practical terms, the endorsement of the ruling issued on 15 June by Judge Harlin Hale of the court of bankruptcies for the northern district of Texas, left helpless to Mexican firms facing the possibility of embargo on their properties in beyond the Bravo.
However, the resolution opens the door to the main glass manufacturer in Mexico to go to the Supreme Court of the United States, claiming three inconsistencies.
From the outset, while the trial judge noted that creditors must be governed by the Bankruptcy Law of the United States, the appeals court of the Fifth Circuit, based in New Orleans, says that the procedure is the main commercial competition processed in Mexico.
The first point would imply disregard international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of companies with trans-national profile.
Secondly, the ruling establishes that without the vote intercompañías, recognized in the critical mass of commercial contest the debts that they had with its array of Vitro subsidiaries, had not been achieved the required majority to approve the restructuring.
However, the possibility the recognize Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro has not been the first case in which it accepts the scheme.
There are a half-dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose debts intercompañías endorsed the Federal Institute of Mercantiles contests.
What is certain, moreover, is that by subtracting the votes of the subsidiaries, anyway creditors of Vitro who fought against it in the courts of the United States, namely "vulture funds" as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergence, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited, will not have achieved majority.
The vote would have been 45 percent against 37.
The fact it omits the Court of appeals.
From another angle, he blames Vitro the difficult situation that faced since 2008 to only glanced at the serious economic crisis faced by the United States, where he received blows the barbs to the country.
For the time being, the signing of the Gonzalez Sada family appealing for reconsideration before the appeals court for the vote comes to full of it, namely the five judges, given that only three voted.
It will not prosper from the Cerciorare resource that requires the review of the process by a higher court, in this case the Supreme Court of the United States.
The serious case is that the court sidestepped a document sent by the government of Mexico under the figure of amicus curiae ("friend of the court"), detailing the procedure followed by Vitro under the framework of the Law of contests Mercantiles, pointing out that this case involving with attachment to the conventions signed by both countries to tie it with Chapter 15 of the Act of bankruptcies in the United States.
Moreover, it is pointed out that the country surrendered to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the rules set for cross-border insolvency cases, that guarantee fairness for debtors and creditors.
Snooker two bands: They Vitro and hit them to the country.
The analysis led by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau just file a criminal lawsuit against the National Securities and Banking Commission who is accused of obstruction of justice.
According to this, the supervisory authority has consistently refused to give reports to the Federal Attorney General's Office on an operation carried out by the entrepreneur to extract of the trust F / 589 del Banco IXE, on behalf of Mexicana de Aviacion 198 million pesos.
The resources have been channelled to the purchase of shares in the Professional Administrator Hotels.
As you know, Azcárraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the hotel chain Posadas.
Meeting over the weekend in a forum at the University of the Caribbean, a group of national and foreign environmentalists, academics, businessmen and members of civil society in general approved the creation of a broad front to oppose the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancún.

Previously the Canacintra had managed to unify the governors of the Southeast area for opposing the monumental subjects that swept through part of protected areas and raises the mother of all the feints against the industry.

The globe-trotting basketball Hector "Hetin" Reyes was more than 60 years linked to the sport of tabloncillo and, thanks to him, he traveled the world.
"I wore many hats in basketball through my life, including several at the same time, as when he was president of the BSN, general manager of the National Team and federal president during the 1990s," recalled Reyes during a visit of Primera Hora at his home in Bayamón, where lies with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
Reyes did not exaggerates when making that statement.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with pictures and memorabilias that denote his long career, prove it.
In all, which holds more emotion are those who recall their passage through the Vaqueros since the mid-1950s as a player until 1982, when he was 15 years serving as coapoderado or seized the franchise.
"Those were my best years, the more I enjoyed it because I had the opportunity to be part of eight Gorchakov championships since 1967, whether as a proxy, coapoderado or leader.
Were many years of satisfaction, including the five championships incurred from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to one in 1981, the year of Jerome Mincy debut in the BSN.
From there on took over "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a great manager, "said Reyes.
Do you want to? "
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players who had Puerto Rico.
Bartow then recommended to the sniper Raymond Gausse, who was nativizado and was one of our best shooters.
The championship of the Vaqueros with Gausse he enjoyed, but at a distance, as in 1988 was already in federal supremo.
By that time he preferred to enjoy their records and Mincy in the National Team.
I remember when I won for the first time in the United States during the Olympic in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we came fourth place and should have been bronze were it not for the Canadian referee that made us to repeat the final game for the second time, said Reyes.
Is that group of the 1990 World is the best National Team that you've seen?
It is among the best, like the one that we won the Dream Team in the Olympics in 2004.
But my favorite was the Pan American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and we gave him a by the team from the United States, which was quite similar to the one that we won the bronze in the world.
The team not only repeated to Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico Lopez and "Piculín" (Ortiz), but also had to (Javier) "Toñito" Columbus and James Carter young people, to the brothers Leon (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quixote" Morales, who had not been able to be in the 1990s due to a knee injury.
With role players like "Canito" Nieves, Paul Alicea and Rolando Hourruitiner youth in place of the suspended players for the mess of the Panamericano de Mar del Plata, we won gold against all odds.
What has been the best player of Puerto Rico?
Without a doubt, that has been Piculín Ortiz.
Their numbers at the level of international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated at that level as it did Piculín.
And that's not counting his career in different leagues that played.
Who has been the best Puerto Rican leader?
This is very difficult.
We have had a very good litter that includes Julio Toro, Flor Melendez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
The young people, I love the work of Leo Arill.
What you was to be done?
There were things that I wanted to implement, such as the regionalization of minor categories.
At least I see the fruit of compulsorias certifications and course for leaders, officials and referees.
That I am pleased.
Larry Hagman, born on September 21, 1931, in Forth Worth, Texas, became world-famous for its central role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R." In the television series "Dallas," in which embodied an unscrupulous businessman, malicious and manipulative.
He was 81 years old.
"Larry was back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, representing again the iconic role that more like him," said the family.
The family of Larry and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for the holiday of Thanksgiving.
He was wearing joy to all who knew.
He was creative, generous, funny, funny, loving and talented, and I extrañaré.
"It was an original and lived life to the fullest," said Gray in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992 and acknowledged that he had drunk a lot for years.
In 1995, he found a malignant tumor in the liver and underwent a transplant.
Years before "Dallas," Hagman became famous on television as a decent guy in the light comedy "I Dream of Jeannie," broadcast by NBC from 1965 to 1970.
It interpreted the captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life is disrupted when he finds an attractive genius, played by Barbara Eden, and takes it away to live with him at his home.
He was also protagonist of two comedies that were little time in the air, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His work in the film roles included well received by critics in "The Group," "Harry and Fool" and "Primary Colors."
But it was his masterful interpretation of the odious gracefully Hagman's J.R. that led to its maximum overdrive.
The the CBS drama series about the Ewing clan and other characters in its orbit was in the air from April 1978 to May 1991.
The phrase "Who shot J.R.?," designed to generate expectation around a full episode of emotions in which Hagman's character was nearly murdered, generated an international speculation and millions of dollars in risky gambling houses.
When the answer was revealed in a chapter in November 1980, an average of 41 million viewers watched him and made "Dallas" in the second most watched entertainment program in history, behind the finale of "MASH" in 1983, which took 50 million viewers.
It was the sister-in-law of J.R., Kristin (played by Mary Crosby) who shot him.
Hagman played Ewing as a corrupt insatiable with a charismatic smile: A tricky businessman and an unfaithful husband who tried to his alcoholic wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), was held.
"I know what I want on the tombstone of J.R.," Hagman said in 1988.
I should say: 'Here lies the honest citizen J.R. Ewing. "
Chief victory, one of the original series, recalled Hagman on Friday as someone "enormous, both inside and outside the screen."
It is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, to millions of fans around the world, and in the hearts of every one of us, that we were lucky.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were aired a few months ago with great success for the channel TNT.
He had already finished the recording of five of the chapters for the second season and a sixth was in the process, reported the chain.
There was no immediate statement from Warner or TNT on how to handle the series loss of Hagman.
A native of Fort Worth, Texas, was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who starred in classics such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan."
While I was there he met the young Swedish designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for a long time in the Californian city of Malibu, where many celebrities reside.
In 2001, titled his memoirs "Hello Darlin ': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life."
"Do not put anything in there that I thought that would hurt someone or affect them in some way," he told Associated Press at that time.
After the liver transplant became promoter of organ donation and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to assist patients fearful.
"I advise, I value, I meet with them when they come to their surgeries, and then," she said in 1996.
I try to offer some solace, like "fear not, it will be a little uncomfortable for a brief time, but they are going to be fine."
It was also anti-smoking activist and participated in several campaigns.
Start course that explores the "End of the world"
But charmé had no idea what was expected in the next couple of months: The cataclysmic hurricane Sandy, a fiscal cliff that some have called "deudarmagedón" and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where Christians theorists of the end of time they believe that it will start the Apocalypse.
"I realized that this was going to be the semester more apocalyptic that there has been," said charmé this week to students at Rutgers University-Camden (New Jersey).
If you look at what has been happening in the world today, as if we were to 30 days and counting, this has been a really good period.
And remember that bad is good for those of apocalyptic mentality.
In Temple, the associate professor Barry vacker is giving the course "Media, Culture and the end of the world."
Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, the zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
"We look at why these ideas proliferate over time," he said, and the way in which offer hypothetical scenarios that guide some human behavior.
If the nuclear material falling into the hands of terrorists, for example, could ignite a war.
This month, the students analyzed films with apocalyptic themes and explored how compared with real-life examples.
"I have tried to inform students about what is possible, probable, credible and impossible," says vacker.
On the main campus of the State University of Pennsylvania, Professor of the History of Latin America Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an associate professor of Art History and Anthropology, team have done to teach a course, titled simply "The end of the world."
Despite the "imminent ruin," students should study, generating projects and take final exams.
At Penn State, the final exam will be taken on the eve of the Apocalypse, which leaves no other option than to students work "until the same night in which it is assumed that the world ends," said Restall.
The courses were quite popular.
"Became saturated in two hours," said Restall on its course for students with high average, which was filled with 35 students.
The students, for their part, ensure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"I find it fascinating to see what people are doing to console themselves to themselves," said Bridgid Robinson, a student from the race on Religion and Sociology of 23 years of Haddonfield, New Jersey, at Rutgers-Camden.
And it is that the apocalyptic mentality, secular or religious, it is only a matter of comfort or the absence of it.
But no student interviewed - and much less a teacher - said to believe in the expiry date of December 21.
"Our first project tried on the Mayan prophecy and desacreditamos it in a certain way," said Julie Zeglen, a student of last year in Temple, 21 and West Chester.
But said that there is an apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture, which dates back several centuries, in which people react to changes around them predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has caused a boom of these speculations.
"Elsewhere, people do not think about this," he said.
In mostly in the English-speaking world.
Joseph were added, a professor of religion at La Salle University who teaches courses in the Philippines this year, responded quickly to the question of whether he knew about a course on the "end of the world" there.
"The Philippines do not participate in the end of the world," he wrote, suggesting an exception to a higher authority.
Restall noted that over the years there has been talk of many days of the final judgment, and said that if nothing happens on 21 December, "people will start to think immediately on the next date" or philosophizing that on 21 December is the beginning of a seven-year period after which will end the world.
Students and teachers are taking lightly the date.
Several said they plan to go to parties "of the end of the world."
"Maybe call some friends to riamos us together," said Samira Ford, 20-year-old communications student.
"Valentino prefers the elegance to the fame"
For the occasion of the sample "Valentino: Teacher of the Seam", who this week in London has been inaugurated, ABC talks with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous customers of the Italian designer
Somerset House, former residence of Isabel I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy to receive an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
The designer has recognized it during the opening of "Valentino: Teacher of the Seam", a huge retrospective that brings together more than 130 dresses of high seam created by its "maison" during the last 50 years.
"I adore this palace", says with its unmistakable Italian accent.
This sample is the colophon of a history whose only protagonist is "il signore" Garavani, but that could not have been written without its distinguished customers.
Valentino has always felt fascination for the rarefied and distant world of the nobility.
In the first room of this exhibition, opened up to the 3 of March, personal letters and photos with the signature of more what has been seeded of the aristocracy abound, from the Princess Salimah Aga Khan up to Lord Snowdon, passing Marie-Chantal of Greece and Daisy of England for the Princess.
Valentino shows those personal memories as trophies of its social rise: of humble fashion designer of the city of Voghera, in the north of Italy, to idol of the international "jet-set-set".
Being fallen in love with the royalty does not have anything of bad one.
"At least they do not turn the stubs of its cigarettes on your magnificent carpet off as they do some beautiful celebrities of the pop music", says the baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the sixties and seventies, we both lived in Alps and were good friends.
"All loved us their being invited to its chalet in Gstaad", explains the exwoman of "Heini" Thyssen, intimate of beauties forgotten as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
And still like this, is a star.
Valeria Mazza, exhibiting a Valentino
The Argentinian model Valeria Mazza does not forget either the charisma of the fashion designer.
We were twenty people, among whom Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr were.
In every detail of the flat, the decoration, the food, the music, in everything it was seen and its spirit was felt.
"To each of the guests it did us to feel important and dear", remembers the "top model", which started to work with it during the Week of High Seam of Paris, in 1995.
"It never goes out of fashion because its designs are works of art", finishes off.
Parade of lineage
He loves the people with good education and better titles, and they love to it.
One of the galleries of Somerset House has been transformed into a glamorous footbridge of sixty meters of long that it suggests a change of roles: the visitor takes the place of the models and must parade for the footbridge to contemplate to a dream-like "audience" that exhibits masterpieces of Valentino, as the dress that chose Jackie Kennedy for its wedding with Aristóteles Onassis, the wardrobe that used Monica Vitti in "The Notte", or a coat of wool and skin that belonged to the Empress Farah Diba.
In that public of dummies names as that of Sibilla of Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit de Noruega, Rosary of Bulgaria or Sofía de Habsburgo, glitter.
Naty Abascal and the fashion designer, in 2006
I remember it perfectly.
It was some trousers, a shirt, a waistcoat "gillette" and a jacket of the collection fall-winter 1971-1972.
"It was a gift that did me he", says Naty Abascal, one of the muses of the designer.
"I prefer it to it above others for its femininity, for its great love to the women, because it enhances our beauty", adds the ex duchess of Feria.
The princess and prescriptora in fashion Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenbergtampoco can forget the first time that dressed a Valentino.
Finally the hour arrived at the end of the nineties.
"It was a dream brought about", says the widow of Rodrigo d'Arenberg.
"Valentino is indifferent in fashion, its obsession is what is timeless", explains this Italian aristocrat that lives among Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
The princess D'Arenberg puts away its dresses of party of the fashion designer with "the maximum cares... because a dress is not only one dress, it is also the ensemble of memories that it entails".
The "king" of the fashion
Four months of work and 25 "ragazze" (as it calls the fashion designer to its seamstresses) to elaborate that silky suit were needed ivory color with inlays of pearls, twelve types of fitting different and a queue of four meters and a half.
According to the journalist Suzy Menkes, maximum authority of the technical press, that dress represents a milestone of the high seam of ends of the 20th century, "the return of the customers of the high society".
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the distinction of higher range in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de L'Ordre des Arts et you give Lettres, honored with the Honor Legion, Garavani accumulates as many honors as any of the couples of its customers.
"Its refinement, its calm, its tidy and perfect aspect has always caught me the attention", recognizes D'Arenberg.
He was in the table of the countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a great friend of mine.
If a princess says it...
The hardest profession of the world: the human mules of Kawah Ijen
There is people for whom its work is a hell and another that, literally, she works in the hell.
One of the 400 miners who earn a living taking sulfur of the volcano Kawah Ijen, is the case of Anto Wijaya in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
For that, it has to take every day up to the fund of its crater down, where the sulfurous gas that emanates from the entrails of the Earth solidifies when getting in contact with the air.
After pulling out big rocks of sulfur, which about 70 kilos in total get to weigh, it hauls them in two baskets of bamboo that it loads on its shoulders across sheer stone footpaths.
They are only 250 meters up to the summit of the volcano, which ascends to 2,386 meters of altitude, but it takes the exhausted carriers more than 40 minutes to promote turtle step, keeping the balance and measuring its steps with tact not to be slid and to fall through the precipice.
They know that any stumble-up could cost them the life, as it happened to a French tourist that fell years through the cliffs of the Kawah Ijen ago.
The miners of Kawah Ijen gain 5 cents of euro for every kilo of sulfur that they extract
, They make the way once among the tourists who photograph them as if they were circus monkeys and, loading wearisomely the heavy baskets, who walk three kilometers up to the scale that a mining company has situated a little more down, at 1,850 meters of height, above.
Is talked about PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that explodes since 1960 the volcano and, never better told, to its workers, to whom he pays 662 Indonesian rupiahs (5 cents of euro) for every kilo of sulfur.
Afterwards it sells it for 10,000 rupiahs (83 cents of euro) to the petrochemical industry, since this mineral is generalized in the daily life and it is used to fabricate matches, fireworks, cosmetic, dynamite and even to whiten the sugar.
There, its salary was of 75,000 rupiahs (6.2 euros) per day and the cut was not so hard, but Anto has returned with its family to Banyuwangi, some people near to the volcano, for a weighty reason that, in Indonesia, is as strong as the sulfur: "I married a youngster of Bali, where they are Hinduist, and I have brought it to Java so that she converts to the Islam."
Anto has asthma, it breathes with difficulty, it coughs constantly and the eyes are irritated for him by the toxic gases
At its 27 years, Anto takes three staking the skin in the Kawah Ijen, whose sulfur has already started to take its toll on it despite the face with a mask and special glasses being covered.
"I will work two years more because I want to open a store or to study Spanish or French", promises in one English more that acceptable.
Challenging the shadows, Anto lowers to the crater being lit with a small flashlight stuck to its helmet, which he himself has bought with its money.
In spite of its abundant profits, the mining company has not mechanized the extraction of the sulfur to save costs and does not supply any equipment to the carriers, that they work for its account and to so much the weight.
"This work is for the beasts and" a well-built carrier of 42 years that takes decades in the Kawah Ijen three, since it left the school, "does not give birth" to the people", protest Madrusin.
Every day, he and its companions extract 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, which three trucks transfer to the store of Tamansari, at 18 kilometers of distance through a path of goats among the undergrowth.
I "will not retire, I will die here because the volcano has been all my life", proclaims Unainik opening well the mouth, where it lacks several teeth.
Singapore looks for babies to overcome the economics
The Singaporeans blame to the race, the stress and the cost of the properties and the education because they do not have children.
I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic wife, let's comply with our civic duty and let's create life!
This is something purely of internet, so we had to make him amusing and cute.
It is the biggest problem in this country.
We are the worst of the world in reproducing ourselves, so we feel that this was a subject that we had to approach.
We knew that the government had tried many things, as launching perfumes with pheromones or organizing evening parties of fast appointments (speed-dating).
Many of those ideas can have been creative, but they not necessarily worked.
So we think, why do we not make the most creative possible thing to solve this problem, which is to compose a rap?
It uses up US$1.300 to the year in policies to encourage the citizens to have more children.
A packet of the government for marriages and fathers grants up to 15,000 dollars for child, extends the licenses for maternity and divides up fiscal profits.
But all this has had little effect.
Singapore is a city state rich and of high technology in the southeast of Asia, also acquaintance for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls.
The birth rate of Singapore, according to its national division of population, is situated at present in 1.2 children for woman.
The last time that was above 2 -known as rate of replacement- it was in 1976.
So Wei Ming, manageress of Policies of Marriage and Family of the National Division of Population, says that it is due to a "better education" and "a wider range of opportunities of race".
"That has allowed to the people to have a wider range of options in terms of goals of life and priorities, apart from being married and forming a family", explains.
These changes in the social norms have contributed to the increase of the bachelorhood, and to delay the marriage and the births, which gives a decrease of the birth rate as result in Singapore.
Meanwhile, a policy of immigration tip ue to increase drastically the immigration to face it to the decrease in population has created resentment among the local population.
In Singapore there are web sites where the hardly disguised xenophobia abounds against many new immigrants, particularly the Chinese, who they criticize for maintaining the low salaries and not integrating.
The increase of the immigration is also seen as one of the reasons for which last year the government party of Singapore experienced its worst electoral result from the independence.
From the choices there has been an attempt to correct the problem, with the fees and higher taxes for the foreign workers.
Whereas the fall in the birth rate has effects known in the economic growth of a nation, the fiscal admissions, the sanitary costs and the policies of immigration, the example of Singapore is also having some unexpected consequences.
For example, it has started to affect the property sector.
The authority of urban development has happened to control the number of small apartments, known as "box of shoes", that can be built in specific areas of the city.
However, there is worry that they can promote a way of life of bachelorhood and big homes, familiar, discourage the developers who want to build.
