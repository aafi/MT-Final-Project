Key questions
Porras indicates that the academician Marc Prensky, master in Pedagogy through the University of Yale and author of the Natives work and Digital Immigrants, minted these terms to explain the phenomenon.
The digital natives are they, the children and youngsters who were born with the technology.
"Also that they are selective when what more imports them is to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences", adds.
According to the specialist, the most effective way of showing children and adolescents what is privacy is through questions that make them reflect.
Next, Porras enumerates some options: There are things that you would not tell to a stranger, why do you make it in the Internet?
O, would you like them to publish a photo of you as the one that you published of a friend?
Do you know what the other ones publish on you?
When photo labels of parties, did you ask the other people for license to label them?
They are the same rules.

According to Guard, it is key to remind the children of the lesson of "do not talk with strangers".
He finishes Summit of the Unasur without making the Declaration of Lima public
The VI presidential Summit of the South American Union of Nations (Unasur) concluded today in Peru without the Declaration of Lima, announced previously and theoretically subscribed by the seven attendant leaders, being made public.
During the day alone was transmitted, in the press room, the video without sound of the presidential assembly with the "session" message "private, audio restricted".
The little information that circulated among the reporters was delivered by the spokesmen of press of some of the governments of the Unasur attendant to the appointment, although not the Peruvian.
In last October, Peru was the host of the III Summit South America-Countries Árabes (CROSS), and on that occasion, despite being required insistently by the press, the also called Declaration of Lima that previously they had announced was not spread either.
In both international appointments, the Peruvian authorities made an effort in that there were transmission systems guaranteed for all the journalists but they limited the obtaining of information to the utmost.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and of Chile, Sebastián Piñera, were brought together during the regional appointment and ratified that they will respect the decision of the (CIJ), that starts Monday in The Hague to listen to the pleas of both parts, in the process that Lima presented against Santiago.
"We will abide and we will execute the sentence that defines the differences that nowadays we are taking to this international court", said Humala, beside its Chilean couple.
The confirmation of both presidents that they will be submitted to the CIJ happened afterwards that Colombia denounced this week the Pact of Bogotá for which it had agreed to submitting to the failures of that international tribunal, after a decision on maritime limits with Nicaragua that it considered severely wrong.
Paraguay, suspended of Unasur since 2011 after the dismissal of its ex president Fernando Lugo, did not share the appointment.
The hosting president, Ollanta Humala, was the person in charge to open the deliberations in the morning and to close the summit, little after the midday of Lima.
It informed that impulse is given to actions to improve "the cooperation in the fight against the insecurity and against the trasnacional organized crime, actions to do more accessible the medicines, the access to the internet to low price in all the corners of South America, and to attend to the risks of natural disasters in a joint and efficient way".
With a Europe in crisis, "the economic consolidation (of Latin America) must not have a triumphalist matrix but must serve for extending nustra productive matrix and glimpsing a better future for our people", added Humala.
"We have decided to privilege a group of 31 emblematic projects that will improve the connection of the spaces of South America, especially in rural areas and of fronteras...uniendo to our countries and generating new economic circuits", said the Peruvian president in a read message.
Among those projects, it mentioned that five correspond to Peru, and estan located in the transversal axes of his territory, from the coast towards Brazil, and two they point to a bigger connection with Ecuador, although it did not give bigger details.
"We wait for the electoral process in that country serving for its re-incorporation into the Union of Nations South American", of which it is at present excluded.
The need that Latin America keeps as a region of prosperity and peace, integrated, and of good relations between neighbors, was another of the matters underlined by the summit.
In this sense, the president of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said the maritime diferendo before initiating its participation in the regional appointment that he expected to be met with its couple of Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico to deal in a respectful form after a failure of the CIJ, questioned by Bogotá.
"On the day of tomorrow (Saturday) it is possible that it has a meeting with the president Daniel Ortega", said Saints.
"With the president Ortega I expect to be able to tell him that we operate this of the most civilized and respectful form possible", added Santos.
Saints and Sandgrouse would find Saturday in Mexico where they plan on attending the taking of command of the new president of that country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
Likewise, as part of the summit, the ministers of Defense of the block met previously to approve the Plan of Action of the year 2013, which it looks for strengthening the dialogue and the consensus on the subject of Defense in the region.
Peru has the presidency pro témpore of the regional block.
"South America must learn of Europe to integrate a citizenship": Rafael Correa
The president of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, stated today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal in which "South America, in this case yes, must learn of Europe".
The project of establishing the South American citizenship that they encourage defended, in that sense, the member countries of the Unasur.
"The free mobility of citizens and workers through any South American country, as it already happens with the members of the Andean Community, have to be obtained, but there are still reactionary sectors that want to return us to the past", warned.
The Ecuadorian president was shown, besides, in favor of the recomposition of the Organization of American States (OEA) under the premise of reducing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon states and taking into account to which they have signed the pact of San José on the human rights.
Those that ever give chair are jeopardized to nothing and, however, us the South Americans we sign it everything.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission of Human Rights is in Washington under the financing of the United States", stated in allusion to the political asylum given to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange, by Ecuador.
He criticized, besides, to the justice Swede because it required it who submits in its territory to the interrogation for a supposed sexual crime when "the Swedish legislation itself allows carrying it out through video conference, which could be done from the embassy of Ecuador in London."
Correa stated that the risk that the physical and mental health of Assange deteriorates exists.
"I have not talked with it since it is in our embassy, but the ambassadress informed me that it had a small pulmonary problem, nothing severe," said the Ecuadorian leader.
What yes there is is the danger that its physical and mental health is deteriorated by being locked up in a powerless small space to make open-air exercises.
Correa indicated that the solution at the asylum granted to Assange since June in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, through the concession of a salvaconducto that allows Ecuador to travel, is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the European legal authorities and underlined that there have been conversations with London in search of a solution to the closing of the founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not deal with human rights, that word we do not use it in this case, but there have been permanent conversations.
"The solution of this problem is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and of the European legal authorities because the lawyer of Assange, Baltazar Garzón, is doing a series of procedures in different European applications", mentioned.
And if Sweden, as perfectly its legislation allows it and as it has done in other cases, questions Mr. Assange in the embassy of Ecuador in London or questions it way Skype is tomorrow finished this problem.
Correa made use to be reaffirmed as a defender of the freedom of the press and pointed out that what she does not tolerate is "the mediocrity, the bad faith and the lie, which impair the freedom of speech".
"We, the oldest enemies of the freedom of the press, are not the wicked and perverse politicians but the bad journalists according to the profit, the blackmail and the extortion", said.
In that aspect it was congratulated that any longer they are not these journalists or the bankers nor the hegemonic and bourgeois countries those that dominate to Ecuador", and anticipated that of being re-elected "it will deepen in the revolution to continue the path and the correct address".
Correa also supported the decision of the veto maintaining Paraguay in the Unasur at least up to its next choices, when arguing that the organism "must be firm and not tolerating the opportunism and the coated coup of legality" because in fact "it destroyed the legitimacy of the Paraguayan democracy".
The Ecuadorian president considered, besides, "perfectly pertinent" the desire for its Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, of negotiating now the maritime limits between both countries with Nicaragua after the failure of the International Court of Justice of The Hague, that it benefited to the Nicaraguan maritime sovereignty.
For the moment that failure is not abided by.
It is a problem between a South American country and a Central American one.
The conflicts are unavoidable, but they must be surpassed by the will of walking together.
With reference to the possibility that seems as candidate in the next presidential choices in Ecuador to look for a third consecutive mandate it indicated that he sees that possibility "with a lot of optimism and joy, although sometimes it is quite hard".
In what is personal the power has never interested me, but in situations as unfair as that of Ecuador that socioeconomic poverty alone can be corrected from the political power.
"My pólitico movement thought that it was I who guaranteed that probable victory, for we have to accept that reponsabilidad," said.
Of gaining would be my last period in the presidency and from there we go out of the public life.
"It is a decision", stated.
"It does not mean a relapse in the state of health of the president Chávez ", commented.
Fabrizio had 21 years of age when they confirmed the result of the test to him: Positive Aids.
"It was as if a bomb fell me", refers when reminiscing about the moment of the advertisement, which the doctor tried to do "more suavecito", without evident success.
He decided to be seen alone of its illness and started to inform itself about it; with such a determination that it already celebrated its birthday 43.
Fabrizio lives with the virus of the human immunodeficiency (HIV) since 22 years ago, something difficult to imagine at the beginning of the nineties, when there were many doubts, few options of treatment and more stigma.
Then, even the director of a private hospital of the IMSS avoided saying goodbye to it "because it brought a cutover".
Then, to have AIDS was synonymous with death.
Now it is possible to survive this syndrome and to make it with quality of life.
However, ignoramuses of its illness, many people still arrive when the virus has already caused destructions, its immune system "used up" and are victims of opportunist infections.
Infectologist and expert in HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva commented that since the year 2008, the scientists had concluded that AIDS was not a fatal sentence, but the years of overexperiences and the quality of life depend of the degree of affectation to the immune system that the patients present when initiating the diagnosis, with better expectation for those who are not users of drugs: of even 30 years with a count of 200 CD4 and of 50 years, when they bring 500 CD4.
In simple words, the previous means that the one who receives the positive diagnosis of HIV at the 25 years of age, under these terms "as long as it keeps in control he will be able to live troublefree until the 75 years", explained the interviewed one.
In order to measure this advance, one may remember that the life expectancy of the Mexicans today is of 76 years on average.
Although the mortality has lowered significantly in the last years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people that die of AIDS lowered of 6.678 cases in 2007 to 4.862 in 2011 (annual report of ONUSIDA), it is also true that from the appearance of AIDS, 60 per cent of the patients in the national database have died.
Only in Jalisco 255 people died in 2011, and 187 deaths go until May of this year; however it is assured that there is universal access to the antirretrovirales drugs since 2005.
- Why do there keep being deaths?
- It seems to me that the problem is not of access to treatment.
It gave a strong data: "Nine of every ten patients arrive when they already present some opportunistic infection the that it has to be done to have a bigger impact on the global mortality, is to do earlier diagnoses and, therefore, tests of detection in a massive way have to be offered, to all the people that require it".
In its proposal specialists and civil servants of the State Board of Advice of Prevention of the AIDS in Jalisco coincide (Coesida), also the patients themselves, as Fabrizio, who went to do the test to a particular laboratory, only motivated to because it had done it a friend and, in spite of its short age, it was already in AIDS stage and even it suffered sarcoma of Kaposi, a cancerous tumor that is one of the common complications.
Everything changes when you know that you have AIDS.
To the date, its fathers only know that cancer suffered.
That the test is done, if they had risk, that between sooner know if they are HIV positive, is better and if they already have the diagnosis, that they learn that they can live as any person, being responsible.
That one, its message, summarizes the motto of battle to AIDS this 2012.
Big are the hollows that there are among the health programs and the common citizen, held Ricardo Salazar, tapatío journalist who has assumed the cause about the HIV.
In the places dedicated to this task "indeed the distribution of condoms has been increased, before gave us of one or two, now give us packets of to a hundred, and that is very well but it works out that there is who today, yet, they do not have access to a condom", said.
He suggested reorienting this inefficient distribution; that the condoms are not only after the counters and those hundred are public in despachadores of baths of the places that the youngsters frequent.
It is not to cause the promiscuity.
Nor it is a matter of paying them the chelas and the motel, as the governor Emilio González answered, when asking him if there would be distribution of condoms in its Administration.
"Like this it is not the sexuality, the best thing is to approach the condoms to those who already practice a sexual activity", noted.
Keys En Jalisco
The state is 4° national place in cases new and accumulated of AIDS and 13° of HIV.
92% of the infections corresponds to the sexual way, to 6% to the blood way and to 2% to the perinatal way.
Itself esteem that 50 a thousand people can be living with HIV since for a registered case there are from 4 to 5 people that do not know it.
A sentence that does not know ratified by a court of appeals of the United States the restructures of the debt of the Group Vitro achieved via a mercantile competition in Mexico, the stage places an awful precedent for any domestic enterprise with ramifications in the adjacent country that has solvency problems.
It would be said, then, that the procedures in endorsement of overexperiences of the signatures that allow the Mexican laws are not valid in the country of the bars and the stars, the opposite way of international agreements.
In the practical ground, the support to the sentence emitted on 15 of June passed by the judge Harlin Hale of the court of Bancarrotas for the north district of Texas, leaves helpless to the Mexican signatures in the face of the possibility of embargo of its properties in beyond the Brave.
However, the resolution opens the door to the main one manufacturer of glass in Mexico to go to the Supreme Court of the United States, claiming three inconsistencies.
For a start, while the judge of the cause indicates that the creditors must be ruled by the Bankruptcy Law of the United States, the court of appeals of the Fifth Circuit, with headquarters in New Orleans, he says that the main procedure is the mercantile competition carried out in Mexico.
The first point would imply not knowing the international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of companies with trasnacional profile.
In the second place, the sentence establishes that without the vote intercompanies, recognized in the critical mass of the mercantile competition the debts that had with its matrix the subsidiaries of Vitro, the majority required to pass had not been achieved the restructures.
However, the Mexican laws recognize the possibility.
In fact, that of Vitro has not been the first case in which the schema is accepted.
There half a dozen of examples are, among them Agremex and Commercial Mexican, whose intercompany debts the Federal Institute of Mercantile Competitions answered for.
What is true, besides, is that subtracting the votes of the subsidiaries, anyway the creditors of Vitro that fought against this one in the Courts of the United States, that is the funds "vulture" as Aurelios Capital, Convergence Aurelios, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, will not have achieved majority.
The vote would have been of 45 per cent against 37.
The Court of appeals omits the data.
From another angle, this one blames to Vitro of the difficult situation that confronted from 2008 to I overcome of the severe economic crisis that confronted the United States, sticking the wags of the tail for her to the country.
For a start, the signature of the family González Sada will lodge a reconsideration resource before the court of appeals itself so that the vote arrives to the plenary session of this one, that is the five magistrates, since three only voted.
Of not prospering this one will be claimed the resource of Cerciorare that requires the revision of the process on the part of a superior application, in this case the Supreme Court of Justice of the United States.
What is severe of the case is that the court placed a document sideways sent by the government of Mexico under the figure of amicus curiae ("friend of the Court"), in which the procedure followed by Vitro under the frame of the Law of Mercantile Competitions is detailed, 15 of the Law of Bankruptcies of the United States indicating that this one was vented this one with the chapter with attachment to the agreements signed by both countries to draw.
, The principles of the Commission of the United Nations for the International Trade is more still indicated that the country was folded, that is the rules fixed for cross-border cases of insolvency, which equity for debtors and creditors guarantee.
Cannon of two bands: they stick Vitro for him and they stick the country for him.

Globetrotter of the basketball Héctor Hetin Kings was more than 60 years tied up with the sport of the tabloncillo and, thanks to it, the entire world traveled.
I "put on many hats in the basketball through my life, including several to the same time, as when it was president of the BSN, general manager of the National Team and federative president during the years 90," it reminded its home of Kings during a visit of Primera Hora in Bayamón, where lives with Isabel, its faithful wife for more than 50 years.
Reyes does not exaggerate when doing that assertion.
The walls of its home, almost all decorated with photos and memorabilias that denote its wide trajectory, like this they vouch for it.
Of all of them, those that it possesses with bigger emotion are those that reminisce about its step for the Cowboys from the middle of the decade of the fifties as player up to 1982, when it celebrated 15 fungiendo years as corepresentative or representative of the exemption.
"Those were my best years, those that I enjoyed more myself because I had the opportunity of belonging to eight championships of the Cowboys since 1967, it was already as representative, co-empowered or leading.
They were many years of satisfactions, including the five championships moved since 1971 up to 1975.
And afterwards I said goodbye with one in 1981, the year of debut of Jerome Mincy in the BSN.
Of there from now on it was done charge "Cuckoo" Ortiz, which was a great administrator", indicated Reyes.
You want it?"
And that was the principle of Mincy, one of the best players that Puerto Rico has had.
Bartow recommended the sniper afterwards Raymond Gausse, which was nativizado and was one of our best handles.
The championship of the Cowboys with Gausse had it to himself, but, then for 1988 already it already to the distance appeared as federative bigwig.
For that time he preferred enjoying its enforceable judgments and those of Mincy in the National Team.
I remember the United States when we beat to him for the first time during the Preolímpico in Mexico of 1989.
Afterwards the World Championship of 1990 came, where we arrive fourth place and had to have been bronze of not being for that Canadian referee that did us to repeat the final move for the second time, said Reyes.
Is that group of the World Championship of 1990 the best National Team that you have seen?
It is among the best, as the one that beat him at the Dream Team in the Olympiads of 2004.
But my favourite was the of the Pan-American in Cuba in 1991, when we gain gold and we gave it one peels the team of the United States, which the bronze was quite similar to the one that gained us in the world championship.
That team not alone repeated To Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz), but also had to (Javier) "Toñito" Columbus and James Carter young, to the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and to Mario "Quixote" Moralities, which had not been able to be in the 90 due to an injury in the knee.
With role players as "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and one juvenile Rolando Hourruitiner in substitution of the players suspended by the mess of the Pan-American of Sea of the Silver, we gain gold against all the predictions.
Which has been the best player of Puerto Rico?
With no doubt, that has been Piculín Ortiz.
Its numbers as for international tournaments are impressive.
Nobody in Puerto Rico has dominated Piculín at that level as he made it.
And that without saying its trajectory in the different leagues that played.
Who has been the best boricua leader?
That is very difficult.
We have had a very good litter that includes Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
Of the youngsters, I like the work of Leo Arill a lot.
What remained you for doing?
There were things which he had wanted to implement, as the regionalization of the smallest categories.
At least I see the fruit of the compulsorias certifications and course for leaders, officers of table and referees.
That pleases me.
Larry Hagman, the 21 of September 1931, in Forth Worth (Texas), born was done worldly famous for its central paper as John Ross Ewing, more known as "J.R"., in the series of television "Dallas", in which it personified a gutless, malicious and manipulatory businessman.
It had 81 years.
"Larry was of turn in its dear natal city of Dallas, representing again the iconic paper that liked more it," said the family.
The family of Larry and its nearest friends were with it in Dallas for the one sold of the Day of Action of Graces.
It took joy to him to all the one that it knew.
It was creative, generous, amusing, cute, affectionate and talented, and I will miss it very much.
"It was an original person and lived the life to the utmost", stated Gray in a communique.
Hagman was diagnosed with hepatic cirrhosis in 1992 and it recognized that it had drunk a lot for years.
In 1995 they found a malignant tumor for him in the liver and it submitted to a transplant.
Years before "Dallas", Hagman was made famous in the television as a decent type in the slight comedy "I Dream of Jeannie", spread by the chain NBC from 1965 to 1970.
In it Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life is seen altered when finds to one attractive genius, interpreted by Barbara Eden, and it is led to live with it to its home, interpreted the captain.
It was a protagonist also of two comedies that were little time to the air, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again (ABC, 1973).
Its work in the cinema included papers well received by the criticism in "The Group", "Harry and Fool" and "Primary Colors".
But it was its magisterial interpretation of the charmingly detestable J.R. the one that it took to Hagman to its maximum stardom.
The dramatic series of the chain CBS on the clan Ewing and other characters in its orbit was to the air of April 1978 at May 1991.
The promotional sentence "Who shot J.R.?"thought to generate expectation about a full episode of emotions in which the character of Hagman is almost murdered, generated an international speculation and millions of dollars risked in bet homes.
When the answer was revealed in a chapter in November 1980, they tuned in to an average of 41 million viewers and they converted "Dallas" in the second he programs of entertainment more seen of the history, behind the end of "MASH" in 1983, that it had 50 million spectators.
It was the sister-in-law of J.R., Kristin (interpreted by Mary Crosby) the one who shot it.
Hagman interpreted to Ewing as one corrupt insatiable with a charismatic smile: a crooked businessman and an unfaithful husband who tried that its alcoholic wife, Sue Ellen (Gray borders), was admitted.
"I know what I want in the tombstone of J.R"., said Hagman in 1988.
He should say: "Here lies the honest citizen J.R. Ewing".
Victoria Principal, supporting player of the original series, reminded Hagman of Friday as somebody "enormous, inside and out of the screen".
It is unforgettable, and irremplazable, for millions of fans in the world, and in the hearts of each of us, who we had the luck of knowing it and loving it.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were transmitted some months with great success ago for the channel TNT.
It had already finished the recording of five of the chapters for the second season and one sixth was in process, informed the chain.
Immediately there was not a pronouncement of Warner nor of TNT about how will handle the loss of Hagman the series.
Native of Fort Worth, Texas, was son of the actress and singer Mary Martin, who estelarizó classic works as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
While it was there it knew the young Swedish designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived during long time in the Californian city of Malibu, where many celebrities live.

"I advise them, I give them value, meet them when they come for its surgeries, and afterwards", indicated in 1996.
Deal of offering some consolation, as "they do not fear, will be a little uncomfortable for a brief time, but they are going to be well".
It was also activist against the habit of smoking and took part in several campaigns.
They initiate course that explores the "End of the world"
But Charmé did not have idea about what waited for him in the following couple of months: The cataclysmic hurricane Sandy, a fiscal precipice that some have called "deudarmagedón" and an increasing conflict that involves Israel, the place where the Christian theoreticians of the end of the times think that the Apocalypse will begin.
"I did not realize that this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester that there has been", said Charmé this week to the students of the University Rutgers-Camden (New Jersey).
If one analyzes what has been happening in the world nowadays as if we were at 30 days and counting, this has been a period good really.
And remember that bad is good for those of apocalyptic mentality.
In Temper, the associate professor Barry Vacker is imparting the course "Means, Culture and the end of the world".
Every week, the students explore apocalyptic subjects as the nuclear warfare, the zombies, the viruses and germs, and the global heating.
"We analyze why these ideas proliferate with time", said, and the way in which they offer hypothetical stages that guide a certain human behavior.
If the nuclear material falls in the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could break out.
This month the students analyzed films with apocalyptic subjects and explored how they are compared with examples of the real life.
"I have tried to inform the students on what is possible, probable, believable and impossible", said Vacker.
In the main campus of the State University of Pennsylvania, the teacher of History of Latin America Matthew Restall and its colleague Amara Solari, an associate professor of Art History and Anthropology, have made team to impart a course, titled only the end of the world.
In spite of the "imminent ruin", the students must study, generate projects and take final examinations.
In Penn State, the final examination will be taken in day before of the Apocalypse, what does not leave to the students one option more to work "until the same night in which it is meant that the world finishes", said Restall.
The courses were quite popular.
It "was saturated in two hours", said Restall on its course for students with high average, which filled up with 35 students.
The students, for its part, assure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"It is me fascinating to see what the people to comfort to itself do", said Bridgid Robinson, a student of the race in Religion and Sociology of 23 years of Haddonfield, New Jersey, in Rutgers-Camden.
And it is that the apocalyptic, secular or religious mentality, is only a question of consolation or of the absence of it.
But no student had an interview - and a lot except a teacher - made out that he believed in the expiry date of the 21st of December.
"Our first project was about the Mayan prophecy and in a certain way discredit it", said Julie Zeglen, student of last year in Temper, of 21 years and of West Chester.
But marked out that there is an apocalyptic anxiety in the occidental culture, which goes back to several centuries, in that the people react to the changes around you predicting the end of the world.
Internet has caused an apogee of these speculations.
"On other sides the people do not think about this", said.
In mainly in the world of English speech.
