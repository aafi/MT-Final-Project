Valentino is a spectacular host whose entertains with generosity and elegance.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to notoriety.
Many years ago, after a fashion show in Piazza di Spagna in Rome, we went for dinner at his flat.
Garavani's life is not a story of obsession, but of well reciprocated love.
Many of these clients say your first Valentino is like your first love, "impossible to forget."
I love the colours he uses, they really stand out and "lend themselves" to your face.
Their proportions are perfect.
As a teenager living in Italy, I dreamed of reaching the age when I'd have the chance to wear one of his evening gowns...
I bought my first Valentino dress to wear at a party in the castle belonging to my cousin, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress, with a frilly skirt, draped "corsage" and a strapless neckline.
The "grand finale" of the Somerset House exhibition is Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding dress from her marriage to Paul of Greece in 1995.
Dazzled for years with the "savoir-être" of the elite, Valentino is now its finest exponent.
The last time I saw him was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Orsay Museum.
"He was immaculate, time stands still for him."
For four euros, the Indonesian volcano porters risk life and limb carrying 70 kilos of sulphur along steep stone paths.
"We generally carry 70 kilos, so we get about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) a trip" explains Anto, who usually make three trips a day.
Each one takes three hours and you end up exhausted, but it means he gets 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) at the end of the day.
Although it seems a pittance for such an inhuman effort, it is three times what he would earn in the field.
"Miners' wages are very high here, whereas coffee harvesting is paid 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) a day and the average monthly wage is two million rupees (167 euros) " explains the porter, who previously worked as a mason in the island resort of Bali.
He has asthma, he has difficulty breathing, coughs constantly and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases from the volcano.
This is the price you have to pay to realise your dreams.
Punished for life, this pleasant, intelligent young man could be a tour guide, waiter or hotel receptionist, but instead he does the work of a mule.
Sharing a filthy wooden hut with other porters, he gets up every day at two in the morning because the sulphur doesn't stop flowing at night, when its characteristic yellow colour turns blue and it glows in the dark.
Some 400 porters carry sulphur baskets on their shoulders from the crater.
In fact, they do not even see any of the 30,000 rupee (2.5 euro) per camera surcharge that, on top of the 15,000 rupee (1.2 euro) entrance fee, the guards of this natural reserve charge to tourists who come to photograph the volcano and their human mules.
He can lift up to 110 kilos, ensuring that he will go on working "all he can" because he needs the money to educate his three children, aged between 18 [months?] and 10 years old.
I won't retire, I'll die here because the volcano has been my whole life.
Although the sulphur burns your throat and stings your eyes when the wind suddenly changes and traps the miners in the thick columns of smoke coming out of the volcano, they are so hardy that no-one complains of serious illnesses... apart, of course, from their common respiratory problems, osteoarthritis, knee pain and sores on the shoulders, which have been misshapen by the weight of the baskets.
Balancing the basket on his back, Unainik can only carry 50 kilos now he is 53 years old.
The oldest of his five children, 30 years old, also works carrying sulphur.
Time passes, but poverty perpetuates from generation to generation in one of the hardest jobs in the world: the one done by human mules in the Kawah Ijen volcano.
"Singapore's population needs to grow."
It may seem unlikely that these verses are part of an advert for mint sweets, but in spite of this - or perhaps because of it - the video went viral on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
The phrases are part of a rap and make use of local references such as "Let's put a bao (bun) in the oven" to make fun of the birth rate in Singapore.
The advertising company that made the video, BBH, is hopeful that the advertisement will manage to focus attention to the problem in a fun way.
Its creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says he wanted to use the power of music to make people perform their "national duty."
1.2 children
But the Singapore Government is not taking it so lightly.
So why are Singaporeans not having children?
Unexpected consequences
The Government is trying not to build so many small houses.
These apartments have a surface of 46 square metres and have been very successful in terms of sales.
This means they are much better for our cash flow.
Although these new rules may be a step towards increasing the national birth rate, when talking to Singaporeans working in the central financial district, it seems they will not have much impact.
What is private offline is private online
Privacy.
According to the Spanish Royal Academy Dictionary, it means the quality of private life or "the level of privacy which a person is entitled to protect from any interference."
How do you apply this definition to their daily life and social networks?
Do they understand the dangers they are exposed to by airing information over the Internet which they probably would not share offline?
ElPeriódico interviewed five children aged between ten and 15 years old who are frequent Internet users.
"They are very secret secrets, I'll tell my mother, but not everybody" he says.
Most are relatives.
I opened Twitter to express myself and post interesting tweets.
"I don't know if they answer me, I only upload them" he adds.
He does not hesitate to reply that he would never accept a request from an unknown person.
The case of Joseph, aged 14, is different.
This teenager has accounts with Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, and in the last case he admits not knowing 20 of the people added to his friends list.
"It doesn't bother me, because we have something in common, like music" he says.
Joseph became a follower on Ask, after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The victim, according to José, did not close his account.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would upload photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Marielos Porras, an English teacher with a degree in Education and Learning, believes that to guide children and teenagers, they should understand that the purpose of social media is to inform.
"The Internet emerged as a means of searching for information, but with the appearance of these websites, the rules of the game changed" he says.
"We are the digital immigrants who have to teach them, when we are still in fact learning" he says.
He says that the issue is complex, "because we are asking them to have a clear policy on what is appropriate or not to disclose, publish or divulge, at an age at which maturity is not conducive to this."
"Telling them not to do it is no good" he adds.
And one more question: does everyone need to know what you're doing all the time?
Another point is to make them see that they must behave online as they do offline.
Stuart Guard, a university professor, primary school teacher and educational consultant, says it is essential for parents to read social networks' policies thoroughly.
Efe repeatedly tried to gain access to the document signed at the Sixth UNASUR Meeting of Heads of State and Government, but Presidential and Chancellery sources initially said they would deliver it after the summit closed, but later they claimed that it will be published at some point on the Peruvian Government website.
When asked about the text, they pointed out that the content had been disclosed by Peruvian President, Ollanta Humala, during a brief statement to the press.
Journalists' access to information from the Summit was restricted at all times.
The only document released during the summit was the list of attending presidents, which angered hundreds of journalists from various national and international media, who asked for more details.
The Peruvian President then sent an email to the media with the "final statement" of the summit, but this was Humala's statement, and not the official document that closed the summit.
The ASPA official website confirms that the document was published last Tuesday.
The summit also concluded with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to accept a ruling by the Hague Court to adjudicate a border dispute between the two countries.
"Chile has been, is and will remain a country that respects international law and the peaceful resolution of disputes, treaties and international courts" added Piñera, greeting Humala with a handshake, alongside the flags of the two countries.
The summit was held with the absence of the Presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rousseff; Venezuela, Hugo Chavez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
The President read the final document which reported that 16 agreements were adopted and the action plans laid down for 31 projects between the South American countries, for a total of 17 billion dollars of investments.
Among the resolutions adopted, it was mentioned that UNASUR countries will take "important steps toward the goal of a South American citizenship, for which residence agreements are being extended."
Also, the final document mentioned the political situation in Paraguay.
"We will review all these paths, [which] are not exclusive, and the treaty with Nicaragua will require a conversation with Nicaragua" he emphasised.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Surinam and Paraguay make up UNASUR, although the latter is currently suspended.
Correa, who took part in the Eleventh Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) held in Lima, told Peru's state television that Europeans "killed one another in the Second World War" and other conflicts, "but are now practically one country."
Correa said he does not regret that decision because with it he has not betrayed his principles, but has respected his "deep democratic and human rights values."
He added that, at the time, "he had reasonable suspicion that Assange would be extradited to another country and that his case would not be respected."
"That would complicate the health of any person" he added.
And he felt that "if Britain says no to the safe-conduct pass, it's over."
They need to be processed in a comprehensive manner to overcome them and move forward.
Additionally, he trusted in a sound conclusion to the maritime boundary dispute opposing Peru and Chile in the same court and said that "it is right for Latin America to refer to international courts if both countries agree to accept losing, however hard it may be."
Correa said that if he loses the elections in February 2013, he will retire from public life.
If I lose, likewise.
Correa also referred to Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez's new health treatment in Cuba.
I just spoke with Venezuelan Vice President Nicolás Maduro and he tells me that Chavez went for treatment that was already planned, routine treatment, and it was expected he would win the campaign and return to Cuba.
In Lima today, the Ecuadorian Head of State attended the Sixth Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), which concluded with calls for greater regional integration to sustain progress, equality and security.
Deaths caused by AIDS are nowadays due to late detection
The boy hid it from his family.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients in the HIV Unit of the Guadalajara Civil Hospital (CHG), where he arrived in 1994 after several battles with his health.
31 years after of the onset of AIDS around the world, at least since the first reported cases, "the great achievement at this time is that the life expectancy of patients starting treatment in good time and the life expectancy of the general population is exactly equal" stated the head of the CHG HIV Unit, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, saying that this information was endorsed in April this year in a prestigious scientific journal.
That's how I view it, and that's how it's been at our hospital.
For at least the last 12 years we've had no shortage of medicine, the problem is that patients arrive in an advanced state of illness because they are unaware of their HIV status, that is to say, the later stages of the disease.
Some people think they're going to die and don't want to know anything.
"If I'm going to die, I'd rather have a blow-out three times a week" they say, but not in my case.
The change was for the better; I eat well, I exercise, I take my drugs.
I live as normal a life as anyone else.
"I work, I take part in a lot of activities, I travel, I have an active but responsible sex life, I take care of myself and the other person" said Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimate secrets with MILENIO JALISCO, to motivate those people with his story who today, in the context of World AIDS Day, are afraid.
Condoms behind the counter.
And the greatest cure is prevention.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are teenagers.
"Why do you want them?" is a common question, asked with sarcasm and judged according to the values of social workers, counsellors, pharmacy workers and healthcare staff who do not want to expose teenagers to sex, said the speaker.
There are 13,435 cumulative cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
Indeed, the UN Model Law for International Trade Law Uniformity was created for this purpose, with the American Law Institute positioned as arbitrator.
Balance Sheet
With the complaints put on the table by the unions of Mexicana Airlines against the former owner of the company, Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, who is accused of mismanagement, dormant for several months, the Airline Pilots Union Association already found the bottleneck.

Hector "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball has been my life"
Few people in Puerto Rico have a mental recollection of local basketball history as broad as that of Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
Reyes was immersed in the sport for over 60 years before being confined to a wheelchair in 2008 following a stroke; he was a minor league player, National Superior Basketball player, BSN representative and manager with the Bayamón Vaqueros or President of the Basketball Federation.
"Basketball has been my life."
Bayamón at heart
I remember that Gene Bartow, who had directed here and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said to me 'I've got a very strong player for you, 6'7" tall.
I remember him saying that if Mincy had given Bayamon one championship, Gausse would help get another.
A team that maybe was not the best in terms of members, but which gave us a gold medal and was a great joy to work with, was the 1995 Pre-Olympic team in Neuquen, Argentina.
What do you consider your greatest achievement in the federation?
Having been part of the National Team's most glorious era between 1988 and 1995 and in the early 90s the BSN had up to 17 teams in a season.
For example, the boys of Ponce only play in their area and only get to face teams from other parts of the island in the national playoffs.
Right now the kids are riding and playing too much, unnecessarily.
What are you doing now?
The most I do is listen to music, watch music videos from my era on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and occasionally go to basketball games.
And of course, enjoy the company of my wife, Elizabeth, who has always been with me.
Actor Larry Hagman dies
Larry Hagman, whose role as oil tycoon predator JR Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, has died.
Hagman, who returned this year as JR in a new season of "Dallas," died on Friday afternoon of cancer complications, according to a family statement provided to the Associated Press by the Warner Bros., producer of "Dallas."
Linda Gray, who played his wife in the original series and the sequel, was with Hagman when he died in a hospital in Dallas, said her publicist, Jeffrey Lane.
It also helped give the series a record audience at the time.
JR got her pregnant then threatened to say she was a prostitute unless she left town, but there were others who also had reasons to attack him.
This is the only deal he lost.
Martin was still a teenager when she had him in 1931 during her marriage to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He tried his luck in the New York theatre scene in the early '50s, and later served in the Air Force from 1952 to 1956, in England.
Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
This term, when Professor of religion, Stuart Charmé, decided to give a course on the end of the world, he knew he had a compelling hook: The end of the "long countdown" of the Mayan calendar, 21 December, which had convinced many people that the end of the world was coming.
And he is not the only professor who offers courses on the "end of the world" this term, theoretically the last in history.
"We don't add '2012' so we always have the option of running the course again, if the world doesn't come to an end" said Restall.
We received emails for weeks and weeks before the start of the term, from people asking if there were any places.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old post-graduate Psychology and Nursing student, said he had seen all the apocalyptic movies.
"I'd never heard of a class that could teach it" he said.
I enjoy it.
The Mayans never predicted the end of the world: it is just a key point in the calendar, said Restall.
We have an indulgence from the Pope.
Valentino is a spectacular host and entertains with generosity and elegance.
Valentino has always preferred the elegance to the notoriety.
Many years ago, after a parade in Piazza di Spagna in Rome, we went to dinner at his apartment.
Garavani's life is not a history of obsessions, but loves well matched.
Many of these clients say that the first Valentino is like the first love, "impossible to forget."
I like the colors that uses, have great light and are "donors" to the face.
The proportions are perfect.
When I was a teenager and was living in Italy, he dreamed of reaching the age and the opportunity to be able to use one of his costumes at night...
I bought my first Valentino dress for use at a party at the castle of my cousin, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress, skirt blowing up, "corsage" drapeado and décolleté word of honour.
The grand finale of the exhibition of Somerset House is the wedding dress of Marie-Chantal Miller in her wedding with Paul of Greece in 1995.
For years, which is obsessed with the savoir-being "of the elite, now Valentino is your best exemplary.
The last time I saw him was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Orsay Museum.

For four euros, carriers of the Indonesian volcano are risking their lives and health loading 70 kilos of sulphur through steep stone paths
"As it is normal load 70 kilos, we made some 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) on each trip," he explains Anto, who often make three doors a day.
It takes three hours in each and ends up ground, but allow him to raise 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) at the end of the day.
Although it seems a pittance for such inhuman effort, is triple what would win in the field.
"The hire of the miners is very high here, where the coffee harvest is paid to 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) a day and the average monthly wage is two million rupees (167 euros)," clarifies the carrier, who previously worked as a mason on the tourist island of Bali.
It has asthma, breathing with difficulty, constantly coughs and irritate the eyes for the toxic gases that fires the volcano.
It is the price we must pay to achieve his dream.
Punished for life, this could be sympathetic and intelligent young tourist guide, a waiter or a hotel receptionist, but instead makes the work of a mule.
Sharing a unclean wooden hut with other carriers, rises every day at two in the morning because the sulphur is flowing at night, when its distinctive blue and yellow becomes shines in the midst of darkness.
About 400 porters loaded baskets of sulfur on their shoulders from the bottom of the crater
In fact, not even being part of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) surcharge for camera that, along with the entry of 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros), this natural park rangers charged to tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
Capable of lifting up to 110 kilos, ensures that abide by working "everything it can" because it needs the money to educate their three children, aged between 18 and 10 years.
I am not jubilaré, I will die here because the volcano has been all my life
Although the sulphur burning throat and rankles the eyes when the wind suddenly changed and traps the miners in the thick columns coming out of the volcano, are so tough that no one complains of suffering serious diseases... beyond, of course, its usual respiratory problems, arthritis, pain in the knees and sores on the shoulders, which have been malformed by the weight of the baskets.
Swinging the basket on his back, Unainik already can only charge 50 kilograms of its 53 years.
His five children, the largest, 30, also works loading sulfur.
Time passes, but misery passed down from generation to generation, one of the toughest jobs in the world: The making of Kawah Ijen human mules.

EFE tried repeatedly to access the document signed in the Sixth Ordinary Meeting of Heads of State and Government of the Unasur, but Foreign Ministry sources and Presidency initially pointed out that they were going to surrender after the closure, but after claimed that at some point will be published on the website of the Peruvian government.
To be consulted by the text, pointed out that the content had been exposed by Peru's president, Ollanta Humala, during a brief statements to the press.
Journalists' access to information from the summit was restricted at all times.
The only document released during the day was the list of presidents assistants, which caused the malaise of hundreds of journalists from various national and international media calling for more data.
Subsequently, the presidency of Peru sent an e-mail to the media with the "final declaration" of the summit, but it is Humala's pronouncement, and not the official document that closed the summit.
On the official website of ASPA can confirm that the document was published last Tuesday.

Correa, who took part in the VI presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), held in Lima, told the state-run TV Peru that Europeans "were killed in World War II," and in other conflicts, "but now they are practically a homeland."
Correa said that he is not repented of that decision because it has not betrayed its principles, but has respected his "profound democratic values and human rights."
He added that, at the time, there was "reasonable suspicion that Assange should be extradited to a third country and did not respect for their process."
"This complicates the health of any person," he added.
And opined that "if Britain gives the safe conduct this morning is running out."

It also relied on a good conclusion of the dispute over maritime boundaries that kept in the same court Peru and Chile and opined that "it is right for Latin America seek international bodies if the two countries agree to accept that it is hard to fault."
Correa said that if it loses the elections of February 2013 will be removed from public life.
If we lose equal.
Correa also referred to the new health treatment of the Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in Cuba.
I have just spoken to the Venezuelan Vice President Nicolás Maduro and tells me that he traveled to a treatment that was already planned, routine, who waited to pass the campaign to return to Cuba.
The head of State participated in Lima today at the VI Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) that ended with calls for greater regional integration to sustain the progress, equality and security.

This view, so we happened in our hospital.
At least in the last 12 years we have not had shortages of medicine, the problem is that patients arrive very advanced unknown because his state of infection, or in the late stages of the disease.
Some people think that they are going to die and do not want to know anything.
"If I am going to die, the better I reviento three times a week," they say not in my case.
The change was to improve, I food well, I exercise, I take the drugs.
I live a normal life, as anyone.
"I work, I have many activities, I travel, I have an active sex life, but shares, I would certainly myself and the other person," listed Fabrizio, who agreed to share their intimacy with Milenio JALISCO to motivate his testimony to those who today, in the framework of the World AIDS Day, they are afraid.
The counter condoms
And the biggest is in prevention.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are teenagers.
"What do they want?" Is a common question, with derision and value judgments of social workers, school counsellors, employees of pharmacies and health personnel, who did not want to expose teenagers, assured the communicator.

"Basketball has been my life."

I remember that Gene Bartow, who had directed here and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), told me: "You have a good strong player, 6 '7" tall.

"Do not add '2012' for always having the option to teach the course again, in the event that the world will not end," said Restall.
We receive e-mail messages for weeks and weeks before the start of the semester, people who asked if there was still place.
Will Wekesa, a student of the career of Psychology and Nursing, 25, said he had seen all the apocalyptic movies.
"I had never heard of a class that could teach that," she said.
I enjoy.
The Mayans never predicted the end of the world; it is just a key point on the calendar, Restall said.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Valentino is a spectacular host and is entertaining with generosity and elegance.
Valentino has always preferred the elegance to the fame.
Many years ago, after a parade in Piazza di Spagna, in Rome, we went to dine to its flat.
The life of Garavani is not a history of obsessions, but of well corresponded loves.
Many of those customers say that the first Valentino is as the first love, "impossible to forget".
I like the colors that he uses a lot, they have big light and they are "donors" to the face.
The proportions are perfect.
When it was adolescent and lived in Italy, it dreamed to get to have the age and the occasion to be able to use one of its evening dresses...
I bought my first dress of Valentino to use in a party in the castle of my cousin, the Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red suit, with skirt of ones blown up, draped "corsage" and word neckline of honor.
The great end of the exhibition of Somerset House is the wedding dress of Marie-Chantal Miller in its wedding with Pablo of Greece in 1995.
Bewildered for years with the "savoir-être" of the elite, Valentino is now its best copy.
The last time that I saw it it was a month in a full dinner in the Museum of Orsay ago.
"It was impeccable, the time does not pass for him".
For four euros, the carriers of the Indonesian volcano stake the life and the health loading 70 kilos of sulfur across steep stone footpaths
"As what is normal is to load 70 kilos, we take about 46,000 rupiahs (3.8 euros) in every journey ", explains Anto, who usually carries out three daily demeanors, to us.
It takes three hours in each and finishes ground, but they allow him to join 138,000 rupiahs (11.5 euros) at the end of the day.
Although a misery seems for that is so inhuman effort, it is the triple of what it would gain in the field.
"The day's wage of the miners is very high here, where the collection of the coffee is paid the day at 15,000 rupiahs (1.2 euros) and the monthly average salary is of two million rupiahs (167 euros)", clarifies the carrier, which before worked as bricklayer in the touristic island of Bali.
It has asthma, it breathes with difficulty, it coughs constantly and the eyes are irritated for him by the toxic gases that the volcano gives off.
It is the price that it must pay to obtain its dream.
Punished by the life, this nice and intelligent youngster could be a touristic guide, waiter or receptionist of a hotel, but instead of that he does the work of a mule.
Sharing a filthy wooden hut with other carriers, every day at two in the dawn is lifted because the sulfur does not stop flowing by night, when its characteristic yellow color becomes blue and shines in the middle of the darkness.
About 400 carriers load the baskets of sulfur on its shoulders from the fund of the crater
In fact, part of the 30,000 rupiahs (2.5 euros) of surcharge for cameraman not even see that, beside the entry of 15,000 rupiahs (1.2 euros), the guards of this nature reserve charge the tourists who go to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
Capable of lifting up to 110 kilos, assures that it will last working "all what can" because it needs the money to educate its three children, of between 18 and 10 years.
I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano has been all my life
Although the sulfur burns the throat and it stings the eyes when the wind changes unexpectedly and catches the miners in the thick columns that go out of the volcano, are so hard that none complain of suffering severe illnesses... further on, of course, of its usual breathing problems, arthrosis, pains in the knees and sores in the shoulders, that themselves have malformado for the weight of the baskets.
Swinging the basket on its back, Unainik can only already load 50 kilos at its 53 years.
Of its five children, the biggest, of 30 years, also works loading sulfur.
The time passes, but the misery perpetuates of generation in generation one of the hardest professions of the world: the one that the human mules of the Kawah Ijen make.
"The population of Singapore needs to grow".
It can seem unbelievable that these verses belong to an advertisement of tablets of mint, but in spite of that - or perhaps due to that - the video turned viral in YouTube in Singapore at the beginning of this year.
The sentences belong to a rap that uses local references as "We are going to put a crossbeam (bun) in the oven" to laugh at the birth rate of Singapore.
The company of publicity that the video, BBH, did cherishes the hope that with the advertisement they manage to catch the attention on the problem in an amusing way.
Its creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says that it wanted to use the power of the music so that the people comply with "his to owe national".
1.2 children
The one that does not take it so quickly is the government of Singapore.
As soon as why do the Singaporeans not have more children?
Unexpected consequences
The government tries that so many small homes are not built.
These apartments have surfaces of 46 square meters and have had a lot of best seller.
This makes it be much better for our cash flow.
Although these new rules can be a step towards the increase of the national birth rate, when talking with the Singaporeans that they work in the financial district of the center it seemed that they are not going to have much effect.
The deprived off line it is deprived online
Privacy.
According to the Dictionary of the Real Spanish Academy they are the quality of private or "the area of the private life that the right to protecting is had of any intrusion".
How does he apply this definition in its daily life and in the social nets?
Does he understand the dangers that it is exposed to because he ventilates in the Internet situations that he would probably not share off-line?
elPeriódico interviewed five boys out of ten and 15 years, frequent users of the net.
"They are very secret secrets, my mummy can know them, but not all the world", states.
The majority are related.
I opened Twitter to express to me and to write interesting tweets.
"I do not know if they answer me, I alone go up them", adds.
It does not doubt to answer that it would never accept an application for an unknown person.
The case of José, of 14 years, is different.
The adolescent possesses open accounts in Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, in the latter last one admits not knowing 20 of the people added in its list of friends.
"It does not frighten me, because we have, the music for example a little in common", indicates.
José was done follower of Ask, after reading a recommendation in Twitter.
The victim, according to José, did not close the account.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would raise photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Marielos Porras, teacher of English and graduate in Education and Learning, considers that in order to orientate the children and the adolescents it must be understood that the purpose of the social nets is to inform.
"Internet rose as a means to look for information, but with the aparecimiento of these places changed the rules of the game", mentions.
"We are the digital immigrants that have to show to them to them, when we are still learning", says.
He comments that the subject is complex, "because we are asking them an age that the maturity does not give for them to have a defined criterion about it is convenient either what not to spread, to publish or to say for that".
"To tell them that it does not do it does not serve", adds.
And one more, all need to know the what you are making every moment?
Another point is to make them see it online that they must act as off line make it.
Estuardo Guardia, university head of department, teacher of primary one and educational consultant, comments that it is indispensable that the family fathers read the policies of the social nets to conscience.
Efe tried in repeated opportunities to enter the document signed in the VI Ordinary Meeting of Heads of State and of Government of the Unasur, but sources of Chancellery and of Presidency indicated in a beginning that they were going to deliver it after the closure, but stated afterwards that in some moment it will be published in the web of the Peruvian Government.
When being consulted by the text, they indicated that the contents had been exposed by the president of Peru, Ollanta Humala, during some brief declarations to the press.
The access of the journalists to the information of the Summit was restricted at all times.
The only document spread during the day was the list of attendant presidents, which caused the uneasiness of hundreds of journalists of different national and international means that asked for bigger data.
Later, the Presidency of Peru e-mailed the means with the "final declaration" of the summit, but it is about the pronouncement of Humala, and not about the official document that closed the summit.
In the official web of CROSS it can be corroborated that the document was published last Tuesday.
The summit concluded also with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru of accepting a failure of the Court of The Hague that annuls a frontier diferendo between both countries.
"Chile has been, is and is going to keep being a respectful country of the international law, of the pacific solution of the controversies, of the treaties and of the international tribunals", added Piñera, and greeted with a handshake Humala, beside the flags of both countries.
The summit was carried out with the absences of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff; Venezuela, Hugo Chávez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
The leader read the final document in the one that it informed that were adopted 16 agreements and were fixed the lines of action for 31 projects among the South American countries for a total of 17 a billion dollars in investments.
Among the adopted agreements he mentioned that the countries of UNASUR will take "important steps towards the goal of a South American citizenship for what we are extending the agreements on residence".
Likewise, the final document mentioned the political situation in Paraguay.
"We are going to revise all these paths, are not exclusive, inclusively the treaty with Nicaragua is going to require a conversation with Nicaragua", underlined.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay integrate UNASUR, although the last country is suspended.
Belt, which took part in the VI presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), celebrated in Lima, declared to the state TV Peru that the Europeans "were killed in the Second World War" and in other conflicts, "but now they are practically a homeland".
Correa assured that it is not repented of that decision because with that it has not betrayed its principles, but has respected its "deep values democratic and of human rights".
It added that, in its moment, "there were founded suspicions that Assange was extradited to a third country and its process was not respected".
"That complicates the health of any person", added.
And he opined that "if Great Britain gives the safe-conduct tomorrow this runs out".
They have to be processed widely to surpass them and to continue ahead.
Likewise it trusted a good conclusion of the litigation for maritime limits that maintain in the same Peru court and Chile and gave an opinion that "it is correct for Latin America to look for international applications if both countries commit themselves to accepting failure for hard that is".
Correa assured that if it loses the elections of February of 2013 she will move away from the public life.
If we lose in the same way.
Correa referred also to the new treatment of health of the Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
I have just talked with the Venezuelan vice-president Nicolás Maduro and he tells me that he traveled to a treatment that was already planned, of routine, which it was expected to pass the campaign to return to Cuba.
The Ecuadorian head of state shared today in Lima in the VI Summit of heads of state and Government of the Union South American Nations (Unasur) that he concluded with called ones to a bigger regional integration to sustain the progress, the equality and the safety.
Deaths by AIDS today are a cause of late detection
The boy concealed it from its family.
He is, undoubtedly, one of the most former patients of the Unit of HIV of the Civil Hospital of Guadalajara (HCG), to which it arrived in 1994 after several battles.
At 31 years of the appearance of the AIDS in the world, at least of the first brought cases, "the great achievement means now that the sobrevida of a patient that initiates treatment in an appropriate form and the sobrevida of the general population, is exactly equal", indicated the head of the Unit of HIV of the HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, after referring that this information was answered for in April of this year in a publication enhanced scientist.
Like this I view it, like this it has succeeded us in our hospital.
At least in the last 12 years we have not had desupplying of medicine the problem is that the patients arrive very advanced because they do not know its state of infection, that is, in late stages of the illness.
Some think that they are going to die and do not want to know anything.
"If I am already going to die, I better burst three times per week", say not in my case.
The change was to improve, I feed well, I do exercise, I take the medicines.
I live a normal life, as any.
"Work, I have many activities, I travel, I have an active, but corresponsable sexual life, I take care to me and to the other person", enumerated Fabrizio, the one who accepted to share its privacy with MILLENNIUM JALISCO to motivate with its testimony to those who today, within the framework of the World Day of AIDS, have fear.
Condoms after the counter
And the biggest is in prevention.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are the adolescents.
"For what you want them?" common question, with slyness and valuable judgments of social workers, school advisers, is employees of drugstores and staff of health, of which the adolescents do not want to run the risk, insured the communicator.
There are 13.435 cases accumulated (12.158 of AIDS and 1.317 of HIV).
In fact, towards that end was created the Model Law of United Nations for the Uniformity of the International Commercial Law, the American Law Institute being placed as referee.
Balance sheet
The complaints placed in the table by the trade unions of Mexicana of Aviation against the exowner of the company, Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, who is accused of fraudulent administration, slept during several months the Union Association of Pilots Lights Pilots it already found the bottleneck.
They surround the Dragon Mart
The investments in the matter exceed the 1.5 trillion dollars.
Héctor Hetin Kings: "The basketball has been my life"
Few people in Puerto Rico has a mental collection of the history of the local basketball as wide as Héctor Hetin Kings has it.
AND is that before that a cerebral loss confined it to a wheelchair in the 2008, Reyes it was immersed in the sport for more than 60 years, was as player of smaller categories, player of the National, empowered and leading Superior Basketball in the BSN with the Cowboys of Bayamón or president of the Basketball Federation.
"The basketball has been my life".
Bayamón in the heart
I remember that Gene Bartow, who it had directed here and was in the University of Alabama (Birmingham), told to me: "I have you a well strong player, of 6" 7" of stature.
Memory which he said that if Mincy had given a championship to Bayamon, Gausse would help another bring more.
A team that perhaps was not the best in terms of staff, but gave us a gold medal and a great joy was that of the Preolímpico of the 1995 in Neuquén, Argentina.
Which do you consider your biggest achievement in the federation?
Having belonged to the most glorious era of the National Team between 1988 and 1995 and that at the beginning of the nineties the BSN had teams up to 17 in a season.
For example, that the boys of Ponce alone played in its area and alone confronted teams of other corners of the Island in the national play-offs.
Right now the children travel and play too much unnecessarily.
What do you make now?
How more I do is to listen to music, to see videos of the music of my period in YouTube, to enjoy me to my grandchildren and from time to time to go to games of basketball.
And clear, to enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, which has always been with me.
The actor Larry Hagman dies
Larry Hagman, whose paper as the oil magnate predator J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" was converted in a symbol of the meanness in the decade of 1980, has died.
Hagman, which went back this year as J.R. in a new season of "Dallas", died on Friday in the afternoon due to cancer complications, according to a communique of the family provided The Associated Press with by the Warner Bros., home producing of "Dallas".
Gray, which interpreted the paper of its wife in the original series and in the sequel, it was with Hagman when it died in a hospital of Dallas, borders said the publicist of it, Jeffrey Lane.
It also helped give a record of audience to the series in that period.
J.R. he got her pregnant and he threatened her afterwards with crossing it out from prostitute unless he left the city, but others also had reasons to attack it.
This is the only one negotiated that lost.
Martin was still an adolescent when it had it in 1931 during its marriage with the lawyer Ben Hagman.
It proved luck in the theater stages of New York at the beginning of the decade of 1950, and acted afterwards in the Air Force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
Every week, the students explore apocalyptic subjects as the nuclear warfare, the zombies, the viruses and germs, and the global heating.
This semester, when the teacher in religion Stuart Charmé decided to impart a course on the end of the world, he knew that he said with an irresistible fish hook: The end of the "long regressive account" of the Mayan Calendar, the 21 of December, which many people as a test that is come the end of the world have clung to.
And he is not an only teacher that offers courses on the "end of the world" this semester, in theory the last one of the history.
"We do not add '2012" always to have with the option of imparting the course again, if the world" is not "finished", said Restall.
We receive messages for electronic mail for weeks and weeks before the beginning of the semester, of people who asked if there was still place.
Will Wekesa, a student of the race of Psychology and Nursing, of 25 years, made out that he had seen all the apocalyptic films.
"It had never listened on a class that could show that", indicated.
I enjoy it.
The Mayan ones never predicted the end of the world; a key issue is so alone in the calendar, said Restall.
We have a pardon of the Pope.
